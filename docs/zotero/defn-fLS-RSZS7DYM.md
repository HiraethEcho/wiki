Definition 2.6. We say that a pair of foliated (F , ∆ = ∑ i aiDi) on X is foliated log smooth if the following conditions hold: (1) (X, ∆) is log smooth. (2) F has only simple singularities. (3) Let S be the support of noninvariant components of ∆. For any closed point x ∈ S, we put Z as the minimal strata of Sing(F ) containing x. After re-indexing, we can assume that x ∈ Di and Di ⊂ S if and only if 1 ≤ i ≤ b. Then Z meets ⋂b i=1 Di transversally, that is dim Z ∩ ⋂b i=1 Di = dim Z − b. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B7HLUL8A?page=13&#x26;annotation=LXWL4NWL">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/LHCALV7Y">Chang 和 Chen, 2023, p. 13</a>)
