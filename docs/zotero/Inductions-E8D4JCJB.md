Inductions

The proofs of Theorem A, Theorem B, Theorem C, Theorem D, Theorem E and Theorem F proceed by induction: • Theorem Fn−1 implies Theorem An; see the main result of [9]. • Theorem En−1 implies Theorem Bn; cf. (4.4). • Theorem An and Theorem Bn imply Theorem Cn; cf. (5.6). • Theorem Dn−1, Theorem Bn and Theorem Cn imply Theorem Dn; cf. (6.6). • Theorem Cn and Theorem Dn imply Theorem En; cf. (7.3). • Theorem Cn and Theorem Dn imply Theorem Fn; cf. (8.1). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HX8EL7YH?page=11&#x26;annotation=IS3TRP53">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/76SMSSXH">Birkar 等, 2009, p. 415</a>)
