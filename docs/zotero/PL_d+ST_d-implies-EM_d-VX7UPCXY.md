PL\_d+ST\_d implies EM\_d

Proof (of Theorem 1.4). We closely follow the proof of [2], Theorem 1.3. Remember that the assumptions imply that pl flips exist in dimension d by Theorem 2.10 and that the special termination holds as in Theorem 2.9. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8T8QCCIH?page=11&#x26;annotation=DV9ZM7F5">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/2425Z23Z">Birkar å’Œ Paun, 2011, p. 87</a>)
