Definition 6.2.3. Let X be a normal quasi-projective variety, B an R-divisor on X, M a nef/X b-divisor on X, and F an algebraically integrable foliation on X. A foliated log resolution of (X, F, B, M) is a birational morphism h : X′ → X such that (X′, F ′ := h−1F , B′ := h∗−1B + Exc(h), M) is foliated log smooth, where Exc(h) is the reduced h-exceptional divisor. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XI4ZRNPE?page=45&#x26;annotation=63MPAGBE">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/3JUBSMBQ">Chen 等, 2023, p. 45</a>)
