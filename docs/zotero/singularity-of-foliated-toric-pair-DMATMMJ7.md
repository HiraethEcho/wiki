singularity of foliated toric pair

***

Theorem 0.6. Let (FW , ∆) be a toric foliated pair on a Q-factorial toric variety XΣ. (1) (Proposition 2.11) If FW has only simple singularities, then it has at worst canonical singualrities. (2) (Corollary 3.10 and Proposition 3.11) If (FW , ∆) is F-dlt, then it is log canonical and FW is non-dicritical. (3) (Proposition 3.12) If (FW , ∆) is canonical, then FW is non-dicritical. (4) (Theorem 1.23 and Proposition 3.3) If XΣ is smooth, then the following statements are equivalent: (a) FW is non-dicritical. (b) FW is strongly non-dicritical (c) FW has only simple singularities. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B7HLUL8A?page=2&#x26;annotation=RTGEXUK9">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/LHCALV7Y">Chang 和 Chen, 2023, p. 2</a>)
