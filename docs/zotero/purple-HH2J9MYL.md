Then we replace Φ : X 99K X′ by Φ ◦ ψ−1 1 : X1 99K X′ and repeat the process. The Sarkisov degree (μ, λ, e) is designed to prove the termination. The invariant (nef threshold) μ lies in a discrete set due to the boundedness of Fano varieties. The invariants (canonical threshold) λ and (the number of crepant divisors) e are related to the singularities of KX with respect to H. The Sarkisov degree drops after the replacement, and the Sarkisov program terminates after finitely many ste”</a></span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9666949%2Fitems%2FGLXUZZJT%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/GLXUZZJT">Wang 和 Chen, p. 2</a></span>)</span>
