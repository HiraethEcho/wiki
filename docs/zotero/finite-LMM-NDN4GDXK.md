Theorem 2.6. Assume (1) of Theorem 1.1 in dimension d. With the setting as in (P) above, assume that A is big/Z. Let C ⊆ LA(V ) be a rational polytope such that (X/Z, B) is klt for any B ∈ C where dim X = d. Then, there are finitely many birational maps φi : X ''( Yi/Z such that for any B ∈ C with KX + B pseudo-effective/Z, there is an i such that (Yi/Z, BYi ) is a log minimal model of (X/Z, B). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8T8QCCIH?page=6&#x26;annotation=T9GP7IDC">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/2425Z23Z">Birkar 和 Paun, 2011, p. 82</a>)
