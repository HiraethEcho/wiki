decompose curve into eff and tangent class

***

Proposition 3.5. Let F be a toric foliation on a Q-factorial toric variety X. Let C be a curve in X such that KF · C &#x3C; 0. Then [C] = [M ] + α where M is a torus invariant curve tangent to the foliation and α is a pseudo-effective class. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2HEDPCTW?page=13&#x26;annotation=24JXYWI7">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/3ZYEHSE9">Wang, 2023, p. 82</a>)
