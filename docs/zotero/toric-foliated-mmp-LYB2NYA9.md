toric foliated mmp

***

Theorem 0.4. Let F be a toric foliation with canonical singularities on a Q-factorial toric variety X. Then the MMP for F exists and ends with a foliation such that KF is nef or a fibration π : X → Z such that F is pulled back from a foliation on Z. Furthermore, F has non-dicritical singularities and the resulting foliation will also have non-dicritical singularities. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2HEDPCTW?page=3&#x26;annotation=3RNHKBWK">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/3ZYEHSE9">Wang, 2023, p. 72</a>)
