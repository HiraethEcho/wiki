PL\_d+ST\_d+NV\_d implies EM\_d

Theorem 3.4.1 (Existence of minimal models). Under the BCHM condition, suppose that the existence of PL flips in dimension n and the special termination of MMP with scaling in dimension n hold, and the non-vanishing theorem holds for a morphism (X, B) → S in dimension n, then the existence of minimal models holds for the morphism (X, B) → S . <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZHR5TSND?page=203&#x26;annotation=J6WD4IJS">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/9RFXPTGM">Kawamata, 2024, p. 195</a>)
