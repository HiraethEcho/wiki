Theorem 5.9. Let π : X −→ Z be a projective morphism to a normal affine variety, (X, D = A + B) be a kawamata log terminal pair of dimension n, where A ≥ 0 is an ample Q-divisor and B ≥ 0. Then (1) The pair (X, D) has a log terminal model μ : X 99K Y . In particular if KX + D is Q-Cartier then the log canonical ring R(X, KX + D) = ⊕ m∈N H0(X, OX(xm(KX + D)y)), is finitely generated. (2) Let V ⊂ DivR(X) be the vector space spanned by the components of D. Then there is a constant δ > 0 such that if G is a prime divisor contained in the stable base locus of KX + D and Ξ ∈ V such that ‖Ξ − D‖ &#x3C; δ, then G is contained in the stable base locus of KX + Ξ. (3) Let W ⊂ V be the smallest rational affine space containing D. Then there is a constant η > 0 and a positive integer r > 0 such that if Ξ ∈ W is any divisor and k is any positive integer such that ‖Ξ − D‖ &#x3C; η and k(KX + Ξ)/r is Cartier, then every component of Fix(k(KX + Ξ)) is a component of the diminished stable base locus of KX + D. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MGYCHESS?page=48&#x26;annotation=MYM82Q5E">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/SESCHRT5">Hacon, p. 48</a>)
