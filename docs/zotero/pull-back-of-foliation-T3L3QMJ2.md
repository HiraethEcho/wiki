pull back of foliation

***

Proposition 3.1. Let F be a toric foliation on a Q-factorial toric variety X, which is determined by a subspace V of NC. If ρ ⊂ V for some ρ ∈ Σ(1), then F is pulled back along some dominant rational map f : X Y with dim(Y ) &#x3C; dim(X). In particular, if KF is not trivial, then F is a pull-back. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2HEDPCTW?page=12&#x26;annotation=AARD5AA3">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/3ZYEHSE9">Wang, 2023, p. 81</a>)
