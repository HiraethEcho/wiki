fmmp for toric foliated pair

***

Theorem 0.8 (Propositions 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3)). Let (FW , ∆) be a toric foliated pair on a complete Q-factorial toric variety XΣ. Then FMMP works for (FW , ∆), and ends with (1) either with a toric foliated pair (G, ∆Y ) on YΣ′ such that KG + ∆Y is nef (2) or with a fibration π : X → Z and FW is pulled back from a foliation H on Z. Moreover, assuming the pair (FW , ∆) is log canonical, if FW is non-dicritical (resp. (FW , ∆) is F-dlt), then both G and H are non-dicritical (resp. both pairs (G, ∆Y ) and (H, π∗∆) are F-dlt). <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B7HLUL8A?page=2&#x26;annotation=8VXDJWJC">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/LHCALV7Y">Chang 和 Chen, 2023, p. 2</a>)
