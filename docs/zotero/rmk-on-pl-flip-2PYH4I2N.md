rmk on pl-flip

Remark 5.2. Note the following: (1) The flip exists if and only if it exists locally over Z. We may therefore assume that Z = SpecA. (2) Assuming that Z = SpecA then the flip exists if and only if R(KX + D) = ⊕ m∈N H0(OX (m(KX + D))) is a finitely generated A-algebra. (3) It immediately follows that f + : X+ → Z is also a small birational morphism with ρ(X+/Z) = 1, X+ is Q-factorial and KX+ + D+ is f +-ample where D+ = φ∗D and φ = (f +)−1 ◦ f : X 99K X+. φ restricts to an isomorphism over Z − f (Ex(f )). (4) It is easy to see that if in the above definition D ∈ DivR(X) instead of D ∈ DivQ(X), then one can choose D′ ∈ DivQ(X) sufficiently close to D such that f : X → Z is a pl-flipping contraction with respect to (X, D). Similarly if xDy = S1 + . . . + Sr with r > 1, then there exists S = Si such that −S is f -ample. Replacing D by D − (xDy − S) we may assume that xDy is irreducible. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MGYCHESS?page=46&#x26;annotation=9HJ3WKNU">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/SESCHRT5">Hacon, p. 46</a>)
