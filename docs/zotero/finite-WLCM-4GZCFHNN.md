Lemma 7.2. Assume Theorem Cn and Theorem Dn. Let π : X −→ U be a projective morphism of normal quasi-projective varieties, where X has dimension n. Suppose that there is a Kawamata log terminal pair (X, ∆0). Fix A ≥ 0, a general ample Q-divisor over U . Let V be a finite dimensional affine subspace of WDivR(X) which is defined over the rationals. Let C ⊂ LA(V ) be a rational polytope. Then there are finitely many birational maps ψj : X Zj over U , 1 ≤ j ≤ l such that if ψ : X Z is a weak log canonical model of KX + ∆ over U , for some ∆ ∈ C, then there is an index 1 ≤ j ≤ l and an isomorphism ξ : Zj −→ Z such that ψ = ξ ◦ ψj. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HX8EL7YH?page=55&#x26;annotation=HIDVXPJJ">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/76SMSSXH">Birkar 等, 2009, p. 459</a>)
