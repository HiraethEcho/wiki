defn filtration of vec sp

***

Definition 2.5. A family of filtrations E is the data of a finite dimensional vector space E and for each facet F of P , an increasing filtration (EF (i))i∈Z of E such that EF (i) = {0} for i 0 and EF (i) = E for some i. We will denote by iF the smallest i ∈ Z such that EF (i) = 0. <a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XEJRGZBZ?page=8&#x26;annotation=TZYNPBPZ">(pdf)</a></a> (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/7B6KB4CI">Clarke 和 Tipler, 2023, p. 392</a>)
