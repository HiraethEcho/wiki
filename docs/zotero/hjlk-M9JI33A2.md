g each Xl, such that fl∗BW = Bl and KW + BW = f ∗ l (KXl + Bl) + X exceptional aliEli with ali > 0 for all fl-exceptional divisors Eli; (3) For any two pairs (X, B = P i biBi), (X′, B′ = P j b′ jB′ j) in the set, a(Bi; X′, B′) ⩾ −bi with strict inequality holding if and only if Bi is exceptional over X′, and a(B′ j; X, B) ⩾ −b′ j with strict inequality holding if and only if B′ j is exceptional over X. Proof. We give a sketch proof for (3) =⇒ (2). Let W be a common resolution which dominates each pair (Xl, Bl = P bliBli) with a birational projective morphism fl : W → Xl and that the union f −1 l∗ Bl ∪ Eli is a divisor with only normal crossing. Let BW = P t dtDt where dt = bli if Dt coincides with any component of ∪lf −1 l∗ Bl, and dt = 1 if Bt is an exceptional divisor over any of Xl. This is well defined thanks to the condition (3).
