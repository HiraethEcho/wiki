The NSF or National Science Foundations is one of the main sources of money for scientific research in the United States. A while ago, I wrote this general letter to the NSF:NSF 或美国国家科学基金会是美国科学研究的主要资金来源之一。前段时间，我给 NSF 写了这封一般信：

> Dear NSF,亲爱的 NSF，
> 
> My name is Dr. Jason Polak. I have a doctorate in mathematics from McGill University in Canada and several published papers. I hope you will pass this letter on to the relevant people in your organization. My letter concerns funding procedures.我叫杰森·波拉克博士。我拥有加拿大麦吉尔大学的数学博士学位，并发表了多篇论文。我希望您能将这封信转达给您组织中的相关人员。我的信涉及资助程序。
> 
> It is clear that mathematics and computer science are at the point where they are starting to have some very serious effects on society. This is especially true concerning AI: AI has the potential to disrupt every aspect of society. It does so in three main ways: it takes away a mass amount of jobs, it isolates people, and it also provides a drug for the general populace so that they do not notice the incredible damage technology has done to the natural world.很明显，数学和计算机科学正处于开始对社会产生一些非常严重影响的地步。对于人工智能来说尤其如此：人工智能有可能颠覆社会的方方面面。它主要通过三种方式做到这一点：它夺走了大量的工作岗位，它孤立了人们，它还为普通民众提供了一种药物，这样他们就不会注意到技术对自然世界造成的难以置信的破坏。
> 
> On the other hand, mathematicians and computer science create the knowledge and technology required for AI and advanced computers. But still, they do not operate within any ethical framework like medical research does. I believe the NSF has the requirement to make sure funding for medical science is only used in ethical research. 另一方面，数学家和计算机科学创造了人工智能和先进计算机所需的知识和技术。但是，它们仍然不像医学研究那样在任何道德框架内运作。我相信 NSF 有要求确保医学科学的资金仅用于伦理研究。
> 
> To this end, I ask that the NSF consider an ethical requirement for mathematicians and computer scientists, too. The NSF should require that mathematicians and computer scientists follow ethical guidelines, which should include a clause that research will not be used for AI, or artificial intelligence, except where the research would identify the dangers of AI.为此，我要求 NSF 也考虑对数学家和计算机科学家的道德要求。NSF 应要求数学家和计算机科学家遵循道德准则，其中应包括一项条款，即研究不会用于人工智能或人工智能，除非研究会识别人工智能的危险。
> 
> Right now, mathematicians and computer scientists have free reign and thus far too much influence on the world without any repercussions. They need to be held to an ethical standard, so all I ask is that your organization considers the development of such a standard so that obviously dangerous technology does not bring society down.现在，数学家和计算机科学家拥有自由统治权，因此对世界的影响太大，没有任何影响。他们需要遵守道德标准，所以我只要求贵组织考虑制定这样的标准，以便明显危险的技术不会破坏社会。
> 
> Sincerely,  
> Jason Polak 真诚地 杰森·波拉克

I have also sent this email out to some individuals at the NSF. So far, the response to this message and other similar messages has been quite disappointing. I think it is unlikely that major funding agencies have any real wisdom or ethics whatsoever beyond the obvious ones that most people understand at a basal level.我还向 NSF 的一些人发送了这封电子邮件。到目前为止，对这条消息和其他类似消息的反应相当令人失望。我认为，除了大多数人在基础层面上理解的显而易见的智慧或道德之外，主要资助机构不太可能拥有任何真正的智慧或道德。
