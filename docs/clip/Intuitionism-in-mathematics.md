Intuitionism in mathematics  
  

In the philosophy of mathematics, intuitionism stems from the view  
originally developed by L. E. J. Brouwer that mathematics derives from  
intuition and is a creation of the mind. It is prefigured most notably  
by [Kant](https://iep.utm.edu/kantview/), Kronecker, [Poincaré](https://iep.utm.edu/poincare/), Borel, and Lebesgue.  
Intuitionism maintains that a mathematical object exists only if it has  
been constructed and that a proposition is true only if a certain  
construction that realizes its truth has been carried out. Thus,  
intuitionism generally entails a form of anti-realism in ontology and  
truth-value, for mathematical objects exist and mathematical  
propositions have truth-values but never independently of our limited  
human cognitive faculties.

Intuitionism can also be understood as a reaction to Cantor’s [set theory](https://iep.utm.edu/set-theo/) in its systematic  
attempt to tame the [infinity  
in mathematics](https://iep.utm.edu/infinite/#H5) by only accepting potentially infinite objects,  
actually finite objects which can always be extended into larger finite  
objects. In this respect, intuitionism preserves the spirit of ancient  
Greek mathematics, where actual infinity used to be avoided by  
techniques such as the method of exhaustion. In his systematic attempt  
to develop a new foundation of mathematics without actually infinite  
collections, Brouwer was famously led to abandon the [law of  
excluded middle](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#SH1b) and introduce a brand new finitary class of objects  
called choice sequences to reconstruct the theory of continuum.

Intuitionism is one of the three major views that dominated debates  
in the foundations of mathematics during the first half of the 20th  
century, along with logicism and formalism. It  
maintains against logicism that logic is a mere part of mathematics and  
against formalism that mathematics has meaning and is unformalizable.  
Intuitionism is also the only school among the three that was in effect  
largely reinforced by Gödel’s [incompleteness results](https://iep.utm.edu/lp-argue/#H1).  
Although it is classical and not intuitionistic mathematics that remains  
widely practiced today, intuitionism has born many fruits in philosophy,  
mathematics, and computer science. Moreover, in addition to the  
historical significance of intuitionism, topics on its mathematics,  
logic, and philosophy continue to be actively explored in the recent  
literature.

In this article, we survey intuitionism as a philosophy of  
mathematics, with emphasis on the philosophical views endorsed by  
Brouwer, Heyting, and [Dummett](https://iep.utm.edu/michael-dummett). Before we  
proceed, however, a few general remark are in order. We must stress that  
intuitionism is not to be regarded as synonymous with constructivism, an  
umbrella term that roughly refers to any particular form of mathematics  
that adopts “we can construct” as the appropriate interpretation of the  
phrase “there exists”. However, intuitionism remains one of the most  
prominent varieties of constructive mathematics in existence. The  
curious reader can see our related entry [constructive  
mathematics](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/) for complementary background. For more on the  
intuitionistic rejection of actual infinities, see also the entry on [the infinite](https://iep.utm.edu/infinite/). Finally, because  
intuitionism advocates a revision of classical mathematics, a certain  
amount of mathematical knowledge is required to fully appreciate some  
parts of this article, most importantly [1.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#secondact) on  
intuitionistic analysis. Readers can check any introductory textbook on  
classical real analysis or topology if they are not familiar with our  
terminology. Some familiarity with basic [set theory](https://iep.utm.edu/set-theo/) will also be  
presupposed in [1.1](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#firstact), in particular regarding transfinite  
ordinals and uncountable cardinalities. Since our focus is  
intuitionistic mathematics, intuitionistic logic is not presented in  
this article. But we include a list of notable theorems and non-theorems  
of intuitionistic logic in the appendix for reference.

## Brouwer

The development of non-Euclidean geometry in the eighteen century put  
some serious pressure on the status of space as a pure form of  
intuition, for it is hard to determine which geometry best describes the  
space of our experience. Intuitionism represents Brouwer’s attempt to  
revise [Kant’s philosophy of  
mathematics](https://iep.utm.edu/kantview/#H3) by renouncing the intuition of space altogether and  
developing a stronger commitment to the pure intuition of time.  
Simply put, Brouwer views all his intuitionistic mathematics as a  
product of temporal intuition. This means in particular that Brouwer is  
open to the use of the tools of [analytic  
geometry](https://iep.utm.edu/descartes-scientific-method/#SH2b) to found geometry on real-number coordinates without appeal  
to spacial intuition.

According to Brouwer, mathematics is a human mental activity  
independent of language, mathematical objects exist only as mental  
constructions given in intuition, and there are no mathematical truths  
which are not graspable by intuition. This means that Brouwer is  
committed to a radical version of anti-realism better characterized as a  
form of mathematical idealism in ontology and truth-value: both the  
existence of mathematical objects and the truth-values of mathematical  
propositions depend on the mind.

Brouwer proposed various articulations of intuitionism throughout his  
career. The germ of his basic views on mathematical intuition, logic,  
and language can be traced back as far as his dissertation on the  
foundation of mathematics. But in this section we  
will concentrate on the presentations found in Brouwer’s late writings.  
Their main distinctive feature is that the development of intuitionistic  
mathematics out of intuition is more methodically described by means of  
two acts.  
These two acts are performed by an idealized mind known as the creating  
subject. The most comprehensive formulations of the background  
philosophy that he adopted to justify his two acts of intuitionism can  
be found in.  
In the following we will examine each one of these acts in turn and  
discuss the role they play in Brouwer’s philosophical justification of  
his intuitionistic mathematics.

## The first act of intuitionism

Intuitionistic mathematics is a creation of the mind and independent  
of language. Brouwer emphasizes this mental dimension of intuitionism  
with the first act, which at the same time separates mathematics from  
language and introduces the “intuition of twoity” as the foundation on  
which the whole edifice of intuitionistic mathematics rests:

> \[…\] intuitionistic mathematics is an essentially languageless  
> activity of the mind having its origin in the perception of a move of  
> time. This perception of a move of time may be described as the falling  
> apart of a life moment into two distinct things, one of which gives way  
> to the other, but is retained by memory. If the twoity thus born is  
> divested of all quality, it passes into the empty form of the common  
> substratum of all twoities. And it is this common substratum, this empty  
> form, which is the basic intuition of mathematics.

As this is a rather brief and difficult passage, in the rest of this  
subsection we will take a closer look at the mental construction of  
mathematical objects according to the intuition of twoity and explore  
the autonomy of intuitionistic mathematics from logic and language. We  
will be drawing from other works by Brouwer to clarify these aspects of  
the first act.

### Mental construction in intuition

The empty twoity is the form “one thing and then another thing”  
shared by all twoities, where a twoity is a pair of a first sensation  
followed by a second one. We intuit a twoity by perceiving the  
succession of two experiences in time, which is understood not in the  
external sense of scientific time but in the internal sense of our time  
consciousness. For example, suppose that we listen to the sounds of two  
successive ticks of a clock. One tick is heard at the initial present  
stage of our awareness, then as the second tick is heard at a new stage,  
the first tick does not completely disappear from consciousness but is  
retained in our memory as just past. Finally, a twoity that pairs these  
sounds is experienced by thinking of both ticks together:

> \[…\] the basic intuition of mathematics (and of every intellectual  
> activity) as the substratum, divested of all quality, of any perception  
> of change, a unity of continuity and discreteness, a possibility of  
> thinking together several entities, connected by a ‘between’, which is  
> never exhausted by the insertion of new entities. Since continuity and  
> discreteness occur as inseparable complements, both having equal rights  
> and being equally clear, it is impossible to avoid one of them as a  
> primitive entity, trying to construe it from the other one, the latter  
> being put forward as self-sufficient; in fact it is impossible to  
> consider it as self-sufficient.

Some comments on the passage quoted above are needed. The same  
formulation of the intuition of twoity found in Brouwer’s statement of  
the first act is paraphrased in almost verbatim style multiple times in  
his later writings, but, as we can see above, he maintained the ideas  
already in his dissertation. The greatest difference is  
that in these early formulations he puts emphasis on a “between” that  
connects the two elements of our perception of two things in time and he  
insists that the discrete and continuum are both inseparable primitive  
complements of each other. From Brouwer’s introduction of the second act  
on, he almost never speaks of the irreducible continuum, but still  
stresses the creation of the between with a twoity. The  
postulation of choice sequences and species with the second act merely  
allows Brouwer to recognize the intuitive continuum as a “matrix of  
‘point cores’” and study it mathematically.

Intuitionistically, the positive integers $1,2,3,…1,2,3,…$ are represented in terms of  
finite ordinals. The intuition of twoity generates in the first instance  
the [ordinal numbers](https://iep.utm.edu/set-theo/#SH4a) two  
and one, as well as all other finite ordinal numbers by the indefinite  
repetition of the process. As the empty twoity is the form of two paired  
things, it can be viewed as a pair of units. One of its elements is  
defined as the number $11$ and the  
empty twoity itself is the number $22$. The discrete fragment of  
intuitionistic mathematics arises from the basic operation of mentally  
constructing new twoities in intuition by pairing the empty twoity and  
its units:

> This empty two-ity and the two unities of which it is composed,  
> constitute the basic mathematical systems. And the basic operation of  
> mathematical construction is the mental creation of the two-ity of two  
> mathematical systems previously acquired, and the consideration of this  
> two-ity as a new mathematical system.

We should stress that, as for Brouwer the empty twoity is intuited  
before its elements are, the number $22$ is constructed before the number $11$ in his mathematical universe. This is  
because $11$ can only be constructed  
by projecting a unit out of the empty twoity. The intuitive nature of  
projection is often emphasized by van Atten (, §1.1;, p.63). Brouwer thinks we  
could not have an empty unity as the starting point because the  
operation of adding another unit would already presuppose the intuition  
of twoity to form a pair of units:

> The first act of construction has *two* discrete things  
> thought together \[…\] F. Meyer \[…\] says that *one* thing is  
> sufficient, because the circumstance that I think of it can be added as  
> a second thing; this is false, for exactly this *adding* (i.e.  
> setting it while the former is retained) *presupposes the intuition  
> of two-ity*; only afterwards this simplest mathematical system is  
> projected on the first thing and the ego *which thinks the  
> thing*.

Indeed, the construction of all the positive integers proceeds as  
follows:  

> The inner experience (roughly sketched):
> 
> twoity;
> 
> twoity stored and preserved aseptically by memory;
> 
> twoity giving rise to the conception of invariable unity;
> 
> twoity and unity giving rise to the conception of unity plus  
> unity;
> 
> threeity as twoity plus unity, and the sequence of natural  
> numbers;
> 
> mathematical systems conceived in such a way that a unity is a  
> mathematical system and that two mathematical systems,
> 
> stored and aseptically preserved by memory, apart from each  
> other,
> 
> can be added; etc.

It is important to note that Brouwer omits the construction of the  
number zero here. It is unclear whether this has to do with its lack of  
a direct representation in intuition, since it was common to exclude  
zero as a natural number during his time. In any event, Brouwer  
introduces zero into his mathematical ontology later as an integer.  
proposes  
alternative ways to accommodate zero and describes constructions of the  
natural numbers and rationals from the intuition of twoity relying on  
the early notion of betweenness advocated in Brouwer’s dissertation. A  
recent interpretation of the construction of the positive integers based  
on Brouwer’s mature writings is developed by based on intuitive operations of  
pairing, projecting, and recollecting.

The intuition of twoity does not just yield the positive integers.  
Brouwer maintains that the first infinite ordinal number $ωω$ and all subsequent countable  
ordinals can be obtained by the indefinite repetition of the creation of  
twoities in time. The first act of  
intuitionism is therefore also able to produce the sequence of  
mathematical objects $ω,ω+1,ω+2,…,ω+ω,…,ω×ω,ω×ω+1,…ω,ω+1,ω+2,…,ω+ω,…,ω×ω,ω×ω+1,…$, but it excludes [uncountable](https://iep.utm.edu/set-theo/#H1) ordinals.  
In fact, in his early writings, Brouwer can be found stressing that  
intuitionistic mathematics only recognizes the existence of countable  
sets. Recall that a set is  
countable if its elements can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with  
the elements of a subset of the set of natural numbers. Just as in  
classical mathematics, the continuum also remains uncountable  
intuitionistically. Of course, this does not mean that Brouwer is  
prepared to deny the existence of the continuum, but only that it cannot  
be reduced to a totality that is supposed to exist as a whole.  
Intuitionistically, we can only make sense of an uncountable set as a  
“denumerably unfinished set”, namely, a set such that as soon as we  
think we have constructed more elements than those in a countable subset  
of it, we can immediately find new elements which should also belong to  
it. Notice that, after the introduction of the second act, this vague  
notion of set assumed in Brouwer’s early writings is abandoned in favor  
of his mature conception of species. In his later works the word “set”  
(*Menge*) is reserved for a spread, a particular kind of species  
of choice sequences. We will examine choice sequences and spreads in  
detail in [1.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#secondact).

### Logic and language

Brouwer stresses that language can only play a non-mathematical  
auxiliary role in the construction of objects out of the intuition of  
twoity. For example, language can be used as a memory aid and to  
communicate some mathematical constructions to others, but what is  
written down can only be justified as an expression of our mental acts.  
This is why Brouwer maintains against Hilbert that freedom from  
contradiction can never guarantee existence. From the intuitionistic  
standpoint, to exist is to be constructed in intuition:

> It is true that mathematics is quite independent of the material  
> world, but to exist in mathematics means: to be constructed by  
> intuition; and the question whether a corresponding language is  
> consistent, is not only unimportant in itself, it is also not a test for  
> mathematical existence.

In its purest form, intuitionistic mathematics consists of acts of  
construction in intuition. Logic and language only come into play later  
in its communication. This independence of mathematics from logic  
immediately leads to a repudiation of logicism, for, intuitionistically,  
mathematics is not part of logic. Rather, it is logic that is a part of  
mathematics:

> While thus mathematics is independent of logic, logic does depend  
> upon mathematics: in the first place intuitive logical reasoning is that  
> special kind of mathematical reasoning which remains if, considering  
> mathematical structures, one restricts oneself to relations of whole and  
> part; the mathematical structures themselves are in no respect  
> especially elementary, so they do not justify any priority of logical  
> reasoning over ordinary mathematical reasoning.

Despite Brouwer’s general downplay of logic, he often stresses that  
if our mathematical constructions are put into words, the logical  
principles of the [law  
of identity](https://iep.utm.edu/aristotle-logic/#H6), the [law of  
noncontradiction](https://iep.utm.edu/aristotle-logic/#H6), and the [Barbara syllogism](https://iep.utm.edu/aristotle-logic/#H9) can  
always be used to arrive at linguistic descriptions of new  
constructions. Nevertheless, he notes  
that in general this cannot be said of the law of excluded middle as  
well, namely, the principle that states that either a proposition or its  
negation holds, for any proposition. The law of excluded middle must be  
rejected in intuitionistic mathematics because it is taken to mean that  
every mathematical proposition can either be proved or refuted. The  
constant presence of open problems in mathematics indicates that this is  
not the case:

> The question of the validity of the principium tertii exclusi is thus  
> equivalent to the question concerning the *possibility of unsolvable  
> mathematical problems*. For the already proclaimed conviction that  
> unsolvable mathematical problems do not exist, no indication of a  
> demonstration is present.

The rejection of the law of excluded middle is very subtle. To avoid  
confusion, notice that intuitionism simply does not accept that this law  
is generally valid for every proposition. It is not denied that the law  
might hold for certain propositions. Indeed, Brouwer insists that there  
will always be admissible uses of the law of excluded middle when  
dealing with properties about finite sets. This is because an exhaustive  
verification running through the elements of the set one by one will  
always terminate. This leads to a proof or refutation of the finitary  
proposition in question. But we have to be careful when working with  
infinite sets because an exhaustive verification is not available to us.  
The repudiation of the law of the excluded middle for infinite domains  
is a direct product of Brouwer’s view of intuitionistic mathematics as  
an activity of the finite human mind.

When discussing logic in the first act of intuitionism, Brouwer often  
connects the rejection of the law of excluded middle to the existence of  
what he calls “fleeing” properties. Roughly, a fleeing property is a  
property of the natural numbers such that for every individual number it  
can be decided whether it holds or not, but we do not know a particular  
number for which it holds, nor that there is no number for which it  
holds. Now, Brouwer often refused to adopt logical symbolism in his  
writings perhaps due to his aversion to formalization, but we will not  
hesitate to employ formal notation in this entry for more precision. We  
say that a property $AA$ on the  
natural numbers is fleeing if the following three conditions are  
met:

- we know that $∀x(A(x)∨¬A(n))∀x(A(x)∨¬A(n))$;
- it is not known so far whether $∃nA(n)∃nA(n)$;
- it is not known so far whether $¬∃nA(n)¬∃nA(n)$.

Every fleeing property therefore provides an unsettled instance of  
the excluded middle. Some properties may cease to be fleeing the moment  
it is found an $nn$ such that $A(n)A(n)$ or if there emerges a proof that no  
such number exists, in which case $∃nA(n)∨¬∃nA(n)∃nA(n)∨¬∃nA(n)$ is decided. But there will always  
be other fleeing properties available to us. In fact, every open problem  
about the natural numbers naturally gives rise to a fleeing property, as  
shown in the following example. Suppose that $A(n)A(n)$ holds iff $nn$ is a counterexample to Goldbach’s  
conjecture, which states that every even natural number greater than  
$22$ is a sum of two primes. Since as  
of this writing this proposition remains a conjecture, we cannot tell  
whether there exists a counterexample nor whether it is impossible that  
a counterexample might exist. Yet, given any particular number we can,  
at least in principle, ignoring practical limitations of time, verify  
whether it is a counterexample or not because, once again, we are  
dealing with a decidable property over the natural numbers. Put  
differently, there exists an effective method for checking whether the  
property holds or not for each number.

Intuitionistic arithmetic is not quite different from its classical  
counterpart. One reason for their similarity is that equality between  
natural numbers is decidable, so $∀n∀m(n=m∨¬n=m)∀n∀m(n=m∨¬n=m)$ is an intuitionistically  
valid instance of the law of excluded middle. This is why Brouwer  
repeatedly insists that on the basis of the first act alone classical  
discrete mathematics “can be rebuilt in a slightly modified form”. Yet, there  
remains several theorems from classical number theory that cannot be  
proved intuitionistically. Perhaps the most notable case in point is the  
absence of the least number principle, which asserts that if a property  
on the natural numbers has a witness then it has a least one. To be  
exact, it can be expressed symbolically as $∃nA(n)→∃n(A(n)∧∀i(i<n→¬A(i)))∃nA(n)→∃n(A(n)∧∀i(i<n→¬A(i)))$. Its failure in intuitionistic  
arithmetic is due to the presence of fleeing properties. To see this,  
let $BB$ be a property such that  $B(n)B(n)$ holds for all $n>0n>0$ but $B(0)B(0)$ holds iff $∃nA(n)∃nA(n)$, where $AA$ is the property considered above  
tracking counterexamples to Goldbach’s conjecture. If this conjecture is  
settled one day we can just pick another open problem to replace $AA$. If the least number principle were to  
hold for $BB$, we would already know  
whether $∃nA(n)∃nA(n)$ or not.  
Given that $AA$ is a fleeing property,  
this is currently undecided. Clearly there are some  
properties for which the least number principle holds. It is just not  
valid for every property in the intuitionistic setting as it is in  
classical number theory.

## The second act of intuitionism

We have seen that the first act of intuitionism postulates the  
construction of the positive integers in intuition as finite ordinals  
and all countable infinite ordinals. We also saw that intuitionistic  
arithmetic already diverges to some extent from classical arithmetic. It  
is however in its distinctive treatment of the continuum that the  
greatest differences between classical and intuitionistic mathematics  
begin to show. To arrive at a satisfactory approach to real analysis  
from the intuitionistic standpoint, Brouwer thought more powerful tools  
than those introduced in the first act are required. The second act  
postulates the admission of species and choice sequences into the domain  
of intuitionistic mathematical objects:

> Admitting two ways of creating new mathematical entities: firstly in  
> the shape of more or less freely proceeding infinite sequences of  
> mathematical entities previously acquired (*so that, for example,  
> infinite decimal fractions having neither exact values, nor any  
> guarantee of ever getting exact values are admitted*); secondly in  
> the shape of mathematical species, i.e. properties supposable for  
> mathematical entities previously acquired, satisfying the condition that  
> if they hold for a certain mathematical entity, they also hold for all  
> mathematical entities which have been defined to be ‘equal to it,  
> definitions of equality having to satisfy the conditions of symmetry,  
> reflexivity and transitivity.

Once again, this is not an entirely clear formulation. In particular,  
Brouwer tends to be rather briefly worded in his articulations of what  
precisely a choice sequence is. The first place where choice sequences  
are accepted is. However, it is not until  
later that they begin to be put to use in the intuitionistic modeling of  
the continuum by means of spreads. Without spending much time discussing  
these novel ideas, Brouwer simply introduces choice sequences as the  
paths through a spread. We will examine the notion  
of spread more carefully when looking at species in [1.2.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#species), but  
for now it will suffice to think of a spread as an infinitely branching  
tree described according to a certain law, where of course infinity is  
understood only in the sense of [potential infinity](https://iep.utm.edu/infinite/#SH1a). So, a  
choice sequence is viewed as a path of nodes growing indefinitely with  
some degree of freedom. While Brouwer does not go far beyond this  
initial vague explanation, he later revisits this characterization of  
choice sequences adding that we can restrict their freedom of  
continuation by a law after each choice as we wish. Multiple  
passing remarks intended to elaborate on law restrictions can be found  
in his writings. For a period, Brouwer even hesitated about accepting  
higher-order restrictions, which allow for a restriction imposed on  
restrictions of choice of elements, and so on. But the details are  
unimportant for our purposes in this entry, given that the idea, first  
introduced in, was ultimately abandoned a  
decade later. We shall therefore focus on  
the ordinary conception of choice sequence with first-order restrictions  
here. Readers interested in higher-order restrictions can see.

The above articulation of the second act also leaves out the two  
special ingredients that Brouwer invokes in his intuitionistic approach  
to real analysis, namely, his principles of continuity and bar  
induction. It is unclear whether Brouwer omitted them from his  
formulation of the second act because he viewed them as mere  
consequences of it. In any case, he never attempted to offer a  
justification for these principles in his writings, though as we shall  
see in the remainder of this section, they are far from being obvious.  
Regardless, the principles of continuity and bar induction are so  
important to intuitionistic analysis that it cannot be done without  
them. They are the ingredients that lead to notable results such as the  
uniform continuity theorem that actually contradict classical analysis.  
In the literature results like this are referred to as “strong  
counterexamples” because they reveal that intuitionistic analysis is not  
a merely restriction of its classical counterpart, as in the case of  
intuitionistic and classical arithmetic, but rather an incomparable  
alternative to it.

### Choice sequences and continuity

Choice sequences are potentially infinite sequences of mathematical  
objects. That is, at every stage in time only a finite initial segment  
of the sequence has been constructed, but the sequence can always be  
continued with the inclusion of a new element. For example, if so far  
the creating subject has only constructed some initial segment $⟨7,5,12,8,23⟩⟨7,5,12,8,23⟩$, they can  
later pick another number of their choosing to extend the sequence with,  
say $4242$. It is not possible to make  
an actually infinite number of choice of elements. Due to the inherently  
finite nature of the human mind the construction process can never be  
finished.

What is special about choice sequences and distinguishes intuitionism  
from all other variants of constructive mathematics such as [Bishop’s brand  
of constructivism](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#H4) is that it is explicitly admitted that their  
elements need not be given by some law. Simply put, a law is any  
procedure that our minds can express by means of an [algorithm](https://iep.utm.edu/computational-theory-of-mind/#H1).  
The notion of choice sequence also admits in addition to elements  
determined algorithmically a unique method of free choice that  
arbitrarily selects a new element. We sometimes say that these elements  
are chosen by the free will of the creating subject. In all his career  
Brouwer saw free choice as a necessary ingredient to go beyond the  
computable reals, the real numbers which can be computed by an algorithm  
and are classically countable. notes that this conviction was  
invalidated when Bishop showed that the set of computable reals remains  
uncountable constructively if all functions admitted are algorithmic. In  
any case, choice sequences remain significant for their philosophical  
and mathematical interest.

It is time to take a closer look at what choice sequences are.  
Although, as we saw earlier, Brouwer does not actually say much about  
them, it is common in the literature to think of a choice sequence as a  
generalization of an algorithmic sequence, that is, a sequence whose  
elements are all determined by an algorithm. Unless explicitly stated  
otherwise, we shall follow the usual convention of denoting algorithmic  
sequences using the small Latin letters $f,g,…f,g,…$ and choice sequences using the small Greek letters  
$α,β,…α,β,…$ Now, to see how  
this generalization works, note that, given any algorithmic  
sequence $ff$, an algorithm determines  
exactly one value $f(n)f(n)$ for every  
positive integer $nn$. In contrast,  
given a choice sequence $αα$, we  
still retain $α(n)α(n)$ as a value  
assigned for each $nn$, but we cannot  
require that this value be effectively calculable by an algorithm. In  
general, at every stage only an initial segment may be known. But recall  
that  
does emphasize that law restrictions can be imposed at will to the  
freedom of continuation of the sequence after each step of its  
construction. To express this more precisely, we may demand that for any  
finite initial segment $⟨α(1),…,α(n)⟩⟨α(1),…,α(n)⟩$ for some positive integer $nn$, there is an algorithm determining a  
non-empty range of possible values for $α(n+1)α(n+1)$ onward. Simply put, instead of  
stipulating that an algorithm determines exactly one value, as in the  
case of algorithmic sequences, we just require that at each stage of the  
construction of a choice sequence its range of possible further values  
be determinable algorithmically. We can calculate the restrictions and  
even subject them to further restrictions at some later point in the  
ever-unfinished construction of the sequence. What need not be  
calculable ahead of time is the exact value of $α(n)α(n)$ for every $nn$. In sum, a choice sequence is  
given by an initial finite segment and a law that determines at every  
subsequence step of the sequence its range of possible future values.  
From this it immediately follows that, from the intuitionistic  
standpoint, an algorithmic sequence is nothing but a special case of a  
choice sequence in which its range of possible values always has exactly  
one element.

Now, let us look at some examples of choice sequences to illustrate  
the idea. The common practice in the literature is to distinguish  
between at least two different kinds of choice sequences depending on  
the information available to the creating subject:

- *lawlike sequences* are choice sequences that are  
	algorithmic. The simplest example is the sequence of positive integers,  
	whose elements are completely determined by the number one and an  
	effective rule that repeatedly applies the successor operation. But any  
	more complex sequence calculable by an algorithm will do.
- *lawless sequences* are choice sequences subject to no law  
	restrictions. At each stage in their construction only a finite initial  
	segment of them can be known. More precisely, after a fixed initial  
	segment of the sequence is stipulated at the outset, there is no law  
	limiting the range of possible future values. Perhaps the most  
	well-known example is that of a sequence obtained by throwing a die with  
	six faces ${1,2,3,4,5,6}{1,2,3,4,5,6}$. For  
	example, if we let $α(1)=1α(1)=1$ be  
	its initial segment, from this point on we cannot know in advance  
	nothing more than that $α(i)∈{1,2,3,4,5,6}α(i)∈{1,2,3,4,5,6}$ for all $i>1i>1$. The terminology “lawless” was suggested by Gödel and  
	introduced by.

Some remarks are in order to avoid confusion. First, note that  
lawlike sequences are to be distinguished from general recursive  
sequences, for, as observes, the intuitionist does  
not accept [Church’s  
thesis](https://iep.utm.edu/lambda-calculi/#SH4a) with respect to laws, which essentially states that every  
lawlike sequence can be computed by a [Turing  
machine](https://iep.utm.edu/computational-theory-of-mind/#SH1a). Even if it might be compelling to identify “mechanically  
computable” with “calculable by a Turing machine”, there are still good  
reasons to abstain from Church’s thesis. Given that intuitionism is a  
product of the human mind, a law is understood as what is humanely  
computable, and that is to be distinguished from a mechanically  
computable process. From the intuitionistic  
perspective, as the states of a mental calculation involve intentional  
aspects having to do with the basic mathematical intuition, for all we  
know, they might go beyond the artificial states of a Turing  
machine. In Brouwer’s work the  
notion of a law is accepted as primitive and left without a  
rigorous definition. His introduction of choice sequences predates the  
work of Church and Turing by nearly two decades, but even after that it  
appears that he never has commented on the status of Church’s thesis.  
For more on the acceptance of this thesis, we refer the reader to. Although  
most intuitionists tend to reject Church’s thesis, McCarty provides a  
systematic investigation of different ways in which it can be understood  
in intuitionistic mathematics. The alternative variety of constructivism  
that accepts this thesis is known as [recursive  
constructivism](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#H3).

Second, in the example given above of a lawless sequence, we have  
limited ahead of time the domain of the sequence to a proper subset of  
the positive integers. Put it differently, we have restricted all  
elements of the sequence to ${1,2,3,4,5,6}{1,2,3,4,5,6}$ from the very beginning, ruling out any other positive  
integers from the lawless sequence. However, how can this be possible if  
lawless sequences are supposed to be subject to no law restrictions?  
There is no contradiction, for our freedom to create a lawless sequence  
guarantees that the range of the sequence can be any range we want. We  
are always allowed to impose a “general a priori restriction” that all  
values belong to a certain domain. It is conceivable, for  
instance, to have a lawless sequence of coin tosses that only has values  
in ${1,2}{1,2}$ depending on whether  
we get heads or tails. What we cannot do is to impose a law during the  
construction of a lawless sequence to further restrict that domain.

Finally, the distinction between lawlike and lawless sequences is not  
exhaustive. It is a very common mistake to assume that all non-lawlike  
sequences are lawless. We simply call a sequence  
non-lawlike if it is a choice sequence that is not lawlike.  
Of course, every lawless sequence is non-lawlike by definition, but the  
converse is false. The following example illustrates why. Given two  
lawless sequences $αα$ and $ββ$, define a new choice sequence $γγ$ by $γ(k)=α(k)+β(k)γ(k)=α(k)+β(k)$. Then $γγ$ is subject to a law restriction,  
but is not given algorithmically. Another example is the choice sequence  
$δδ$ which oscillates between  
$αα$ and $ββ$ on even and odds arguments, that  
is, $δ(2k)=α(k)δ(2k)=α(k)$ and $δ(2k+1)=β(k)δ(2k+1)=β(k)$. In general,  
non-lawlike sequences enjoy an intermediate degree of freedom, involving  
both law restrictions and free choice. The best well-known example of a  
class of choice sequences that exhibit this intermediate nature is  
that of *hesitant sequences*, choice  
sequences that start out lawless but a law may or may not be adopted to  
determine future values. If a law is accepted from the very beginning or  
never accepted then the particular sequence is in fact lawlike or  
lawless respectively, but it remains neither if the antecedent is not  
the case.

#### Continuity

Since choice sequences are permanently in a process of growth and can  
never be admitted as completed mathematical objects, how can we do  
mathematics with them? First of all, when dealing with choice sequences,  
we must carefully distinguish between intensional and extensional  
equality. As one might expect, two choice sequences $αα$ and $ββ$ are extensionally equal iff they  
have the same values for the same arguments: 
$$
α=β↔∀nα(n)=β(n).α=β↔∀nα(n)=β(n).
$$

Strictly speaking, however, we should also distinguish between the  
laws according to which the sequence might be given to us. Simply put,  
two sequences might be extensionally equal but still be intensionally  
different if they are given by different laws. We commonly write $α≡βα≡β$ to indicate that  
$αα$ and $ββ$ are intensionally equal. We are  
often especially interested in properties that respect extensionality in  
intuitionistic mathematics. We say that a property $AA$ of choice sequences is extensional iff  
the following holds: 
$$
∀α∀β(A(α)∧α=β→A(β)).∀α∀β(A(α)∧α=β→A(β)).
$$

It is worth noting that a choice sequence might be extensionally  
equal to a lawlike sequence but not necessarily given as a lawlike  
one. It  
is not even generally possible to determine when a supposedly lawless  
sequence actually turns out to determine a lawlike  
sequence extensionally. To borrow Borel’s metaphor, if we give an  
infinite amount of time to a monkey hitting number keys at random in a  
typewriter, then in principle the monkey could end up reproducing the  
Fibonacci sequence, for instance. That is to say, the creating subject  
cannot be certain that they are not following an unknown law when  
constructing a choice sequence until the very end, and yet the  
construction will never end. Let me clarify that this does not mean that  
a lawless sequence can in fact be lawlike. We may say the sequence is  
intensionally lawless but extensionally lawlike in the sense above.

In the remainder of this subsection we assume that all properties are  
extensional. Now, to motivate Brouwer’s principle of continuity, it  
might be useful to start with some general remarks on the acceptance of  
the [axiom  
of choice](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#SH1f) in intuitionism. The simplest version of the axiom states  
that if for every natural number $nn$  
there is some $mm$ such that $A(n,m)A(n,m)$, there exists a function $ff$ such that $A(n,f(n))A(n,f(n))$ for every $nn$. In symbols: 
$$
∀n∃mA(n,m)→∃f∀nA(n,f(n)).∀n∃mA(n,m)→∃f∀nA(n,f(n)).
$$

To avoid confusion, we stress that here $ff$ denotes a function and not a lawlike  
sequence. The above principle is in fact perfectly valid  
intuitionistically. It is a direct consequence of the meaning of the  
intuitionistic logical constants, for the antecedent has a form $∀x∃yA(x,y)∀x∃yA(x,y)$ and its truth  
presupposes a procedure that transforms every object $xx$ into a pair that contains a specific  
$yy$ and a proof that $A(x,y)A(x,y)$. We will look more closely at this  
informal semantics when studying Heyting’s meaning explanations in [2.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#heytingmeaning). The point is that the  
constructive meaning of existence yields an “operation” that in this  
particular case serves as a choice function because intensional and  
extensional equality coincide. Therefore, controversies surrounding the  
axiom of choice arise in intuitionistic mathematics only when  
intensional and extensional equality diverge. We refer the reader to  
for a  
recent comprehensive overview of the status of the axiom of choice in  
various intuitionistic and constructivist systems. In the general  
version of the axiom of choice, we drop the above restriction to the  
natural numbers and consider any set (or rather species). In this form,  
the axiom is false because intensional and extensional equality need not  
always agree. We have already seen that that is not the case for choice  
sequences in general.

What does this have to do with continuity? We can think of a  
continuity principle as a more assertive version of the axiom choice  
that tells us how to manipulate choice sequences. If instead of the  
natural number $nn$ we consider a  
choice sequence $αα$ in the above  
formula, the resulting version of the axiom of choice $∀α∃mA(α,m)→∃f∀αA(α,f(α))∀α∃mA(α,m)→∃f∀αA(α,f(α))$ is false. Even when $AA$ is an extensional property, the  
function $ff$ need not respect  
extensional equality. So, if $α=βα=β$ then $f(α)=f(β)f(α)=f(β)$ might not hold, unless $α≡βα≡β$ also holds. It is  
possible that $A(α,f(α))A(α,f(α))$  
is true but not $A(β,f(β))A(β,f(β))$  
or vice-versa, contradicting the assumption that $AA$ is an extensional property. To overcome  
this obstacle, intuitionists need to impose an additional requirement to  
the admissible choice functions to guarantee the preservation of  
extensional propertiesand this is where continuity enters the picture.  
One solution is to restrict them to those belonging to a class of  
“neighborhood functions” $KK$  
that allow us to determine their value in a finitistic way. They are  
usually denoted by the letter “ $ee$ ”  
rather than “ $ff$ ” in the literature  
because of their special status. If $e∈Ke∈K$, then $e(α)e(α)$  
is calculable from a finite amount of information known about $αα$, such as the finite initial  
segment of the sequence or the law restrictions imposed up until a  
certain stage. The value $e(α)e(α)$  
never depends on all the elements of the sequence, but only from what we  
know about $αα$ at some point.  
This means that such a function $ee$  
is in effect only ever applied to initial segments.

So, as the domain of a neighborhood function actually consists of  
finite sequences, strictly speaking, the notation “ $e(α)e(α)$ ” makes a category mistake.  
However, we can treat $e(α)e(α)$ as  
an abbreviation for the value of $ee$  
on the smallest sufficiently long initial segment of $αα$. Put another way, if, intuitively,  
$e(––α(n))=0e(α―(n))=0$ means  
that the initial segment $––α(n)α―(n)$ is not sufficiently  
long enough to compute the value of $ee$ for $αα$, then 
$$
e(α) is defined iff ∃n(e(––α(n))>0),e(α) is defined iff ∃n(e(α―(n))>0),
$$
$$
e(α)=k iff ∃n(––α(n)=k+1)∧∀m(m<n→––α(n)=0).e(α)=k iff ∃n(α―(n)=k+1)∧∀m(m<n→α―(n)=0).
$$

Now, $e(α)=e(β)e(α)=e(β)$ holds  
because $ee$ is continuous in a  
precise sense. Although this is not to place  
to enter into detail, the basic idea is this. Suppose for the moment  
that we are dealing only with arbitrary, unrestricted choice sequences.  
Then the topological space in question can be studied as a Baire space,  
whose neighborhoods consist of all species of choice sequences sharing  
the same initial segment of some length. Readers need not worry if the  
concept of a Baire space is unfamilar to them, for it essentially  
describes the universal spread soon to be discussed in [1.2.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#species). Topologically, $ee$ serves as a continuous function from  
this Baire space to the natural numbers with the discrete topology, the  
space consisting of every subset of the natural numbers as a  
neighborhood. Continuity means that, given any choice sequence $αα$, for every neighborhood $N(e(α))N(e(α))$, there exists a  
neighborhood $M(α)M(α)$ such that if  
$β∈M(α)β∈M(α)$ then $e(β)∈N(e(α))e(β)∈N(e(α))$. The equality  
$e(α)=e(β)e(α)=e(β)$ immediately  
follows because, under the discrete topology, the singleton ${e(α)}{e(α)}$ is a neighborhood of its  
element. Notice that we only focused our attention on the universal  
spread in the example above for the sake of simplicity, but similar  
considerations also apply to neighborhood functions associated with  
choice sequences that admit restrictions.

Once again, it is not our interest to dive into topology in this  
survey. As far as intuitionism is concerned in the philosophy of  
mathematics, the important thing to keep in mind is that such a $∀α∃n∀α∃n$ -continuity principle results from the imposition of  
continuity to the otherwise problematic choice principle $∀α∃mA(α,m)→∃f∀αA(α,f(α))∀α∃mA(α,m)→∃f∀αA(α,f(α))$ mentioned above. The  
antecedent remains unchanged, but the consequent states that there  
exists a neighborhood function $ee$  
such that for every $αα$ for  
which $ee$ is defined, $A(α,e(α)A(α,e(α)$ holds. If we write  
$e(α)>0e(α)>0$ to mean that $ee$ is defined for $αα$, then the resulting principle can  
be stated as follows:

$$
∀α∃nA(α,n)→∃e∈K∀α(e(α)>0→A(α,e(α))).(C-N)(C-N)∀α∃nA(α,n)→∃e∈K∀α(e(α)>0→A(α,e(α))).
$$

This is one of the formulations of Brouwer’s continuity principle. It  
is commonly described as the full version of continuity to distinguish  
it from a weaker formulation for the natural numbers that can be derived  
from it. Let the equality $––α(m)=––β(m)α―(m)=β―(m)$ abbreviate the fact that the initial  
segments of length $mm$ of $αα$ and $ββ$ agree, which we can symbolically  
represent as $∀i<m(α(i)=β(i))∀i<m(α(i)=β(i))$. We can state the weak continuity principle as:

$$
∀α∃nA(α,n)→∀α∃m∃n∀β(––β(m)=––α(m)→A(β,n)).(WC-N)(WC-N)∀α∃nA(α,n)→∀α∃m∃n∀β(β―(m)=α―(m)→A(β,n)).
$$

The only difference between these two principles is the consequent.  
Indeed, in ([\[wcn\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#wcn)) the requirement that there be a  
neighborhood function is dropped. Informally, the consequent says that  
given an $αα$, we can find a  
fixed length $mm$ such that for some  
$nn$ and any $ββ$ whose the initial segments of  
length $mm$ agrees with $αα$, $A(β,n)A(β,n)$ holds. As note, Brouwer  
used this continuity principle for the first time to show that the set  
of numerical choice sequences is not enumerable. They also investigate  
justifications for versions of the weak continuity principle ([\[wcn\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#wcn)).  
As they point out, this principle is evident for lawless sequences  
because we never know more than a finite segment of them in advance. But  
for lawlike sequence it is less obvious since law restrictions might be  
taken into account.

These are not the only continuity principles considered in  
intuitionism. An even stronger form of continuity is usually discussed  
under the name of $∀α∃β∀α∃β$ -continuity. It  
can be regarded as a generalization of the full continuity principle ([\[cn\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#cn)) where  
the existential statement about numbers is instead about choice  
sequences. It is articulated by considering a partial higher-order  
function $||$ that given a  
neighborhood function $ee$ and choice  
sequence $αα$ returns a choice  
sequence $e|αe|α$ if it satisfies  
some technical conditions:

$$
∀α∃βA(α,β)→∃e∈K∀αA(α,e|α).(SC-N)(SC-N)∀α∃βA(α,β)→∃e∈K∀αA(α,e|α).
$$

The status of the $∀α∃β∀α∃β$ -continuity  
principle is more controversial. sees this it as a dubious  
principle, as “it is far from plain that it is intuitionistically  
correct”. While it might initially be seen that $∀α∃β∀α∃β$ -continuity  
leads to contradictions in creating subject contexts, explains that  
it is valid intuitionistically and that the clash only arises if one  
forgets about the restriction to extensional properties.

Continuity principles allow us to refute some classical theorems. It  
provides us with theorems that contradict results in classical  
mathematics. stresses that even the weak  
continuity principle implies the negation of a quantified version of the  
law of excluded middle $¬∀α(∀nα(n)=0∨¬∀nα(n)=0)¬∀α(∀nα(n)=0∨¬∀nα(n)=0)$. More  
precisely, unlike intuitionistic logic, which is not incompatible with  
classically valid principles, intuitionistic mathematics actually  
refutes classical logic (not just classical mathematics)! The full  
continuity principle can be used to prove that every total real function  
is continuous in intuitionistic analysis. We will discuss the  
intuitionistic construction of the real numbers in [1.2.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#species). To  
be clear, however, we stress that discontinuous functions can be  
defined, but they are not total. For an overview of these and  
other consequences of the continuity principles, such as a derivation of  
weak continuity ([\[wcn\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#wcn)) from full continuity ([\[cn\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#cn)), see. A more  
general mathematical account is given by.

### Species, spreads, and bar induction

Species are the closest analog in intuitionism to sets as used in  
classical mathematics. But at the same time they exhibit significant  
differences that should be emphasized. In a nutshell, a species is a  
property that previously constructed mathematical objects may possess.  
When a species $SS$ is defined by a  
certain property $AA$, we write $S={x∣A(x)}S={x∣A(x)}$. If $A(a)A(a)$ holds, we say that a formerly  
obtained object $aa$ is an element of  
$SS$ and we write $a∈Sa∈S$. Brouwer always highlights the  
following facts when introducing the notion of species in the second  
act:

1. a species can be an element of another species, but never an  
	element of itself. That is to say that [predicativity](https://iep.utm.edu/predicative-and-impredicative-definitions/)  
	is a built-in feature of species. This is how the intuitionist is able  
	to circumvent circularities like [Russell’s paradox](https://iep.utm.edu/par-russ). In a sense,  
	there is a clear resemblance with the [theory of types](https://iep.utm.edu/russ-log/#H2). The  
	universe of species can be stratified into a hierarchy depending on  
	their order: first-order species may only have elements which are not  
	themselves given as species; second-order species may only have as  
	elements objects given as first-order species and so on.
2. a species always has an equality relation defined among its  
	elements. The equality associated with the definition of a species $SS$ must always be an equivalence  
	relation $RR$ such that if $a∈Sa∈S$ and $R(a,b)R(a,b)$ then $b∈Sb∈S$. We write $a=Sba=Sb$ to  
	denote $R(a,b)R(a,b)$. This ternary  
	equality relation is to be distinguished from the binary relations of  
	intensional and extensional identity considered previously for choice  
	sequences, for instance.
3. we can redefine the same species time and again. To understand  
	why this is useful, recall that only for entities constructed prior to  
	the definition of a species may we ask if they possess the corresponding  
	property. When a species $SS$ is  
	introduced no other mathematical object $bb$ constructed after this point in time  
	can be a member of it, even if they turn out to satisfy the same  
	property $AA$ that defined $SS$! In order to accommodate this missing  
	element, we can redefine the species $SS$ again after constructing $bb$. Thus, roughly speaking, a species can  
	change their membership relation over time. We never lose its former  
	elements but we might gain new ones after the redefinition.

Just as with the notion of a choice sequence, which necessarily grow  
over time, with species temporality is witnessed in the second act of  
intuitionism. This should not come as a surprise, for, as already seen  
earlier, intuitionistic mathematics is based on the intuition of time.  
Besides, like choice sequences, species are intrinsically intensional  
since two species are in fact one and the same only when given by the  
same property.

How are species used to construct the intuitionistic continuum?  
First, let us remark that the classical constructions of the set of  
integers $ZZ$ and  
rationals $QQ$ are  
essentially acceptable intuitionistically, except that we are dealing  
with species instead. Moreover, it should be noted that they are not  
regarded as a finished totality. They can be defined with the usual  
equivalence relations by considering the equivalence classes as species.  
But due to the intensionality that species carry with them, we need to  
maintain some fine grained distinctions not present in classical set  
theory. For example, the subset of natural numbers in the integers $NZNZ$ and in the  
rationals $NQNQ$ are  
not identical species. The construction of the species $RR$ is sometimes said to be  
analogous to the construction of the reals in terms of Cauchy sequences  
in classical mathematics. This is true in a sense, but the description  
downplays the role of choice sequences. In the intuitionistic approach  
to mathematics, the notion of choice sequence first comes into play in  
the definition of $RR$ as the  
species of equivalence classes of convergent choice sequences of  
rationals. Let $α=⟨ri⟩iα=⟨ri⟩i$ be a choice  
sequence of rational numbers. We say that $αα$ is convergent iff its elements  
eventually get closer and closer to one another. More precisely, 
$$
∀k∃n∀m(|rn–rn+m|<Q2−k).∀k∃n∀m(|rn–rn+m|<Q2−k).
$$

Two choice sequences $α=⟨ri⟩iα=⟨ri⟩i$ and $β=⟨si⟩iβ=⟨si⟩i$ coincide, in symbols, $α≃βα≃β$, when their own  
elements eventually get closer and closer to one another: 
$$
∀k∃n∀m(|rn+m–sn+m|<Q2−k).∀k∃n∀m(|rn+m–sn+m|<Q2−k).
$$

We call a convergent choice sequence of rational numbers a real  
number generator. Now, let a real number be the equivalence class ${β∣α≃β}{β∣α≃β}$ for  
some real number generator $αα$.  
Finally, the species $RR$ is  
simply defined as the species of all real numbers. For accessible  
accounts of the intuitionistic continuum, see or. It is worth emphasizing that,  
unlike in [Bishop’s  
constructive mathematics](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#H4), for example, intuitionistically the real  
numbers are not convergent sequences of rational numbers themselves.  
Real numbers remain treated as equivalence classes in intuitionism just  
as they are in classical mathematics. In this sense, intuitionism stays  
relatively closer to classical mathematics.

#### Spread

In fact, a species of choice sequences of rationals is what we call a  
spread. We can view a spread as a tree in which each node is a finite  
sequence but every path is infinite. As we mentioned earlier, a choice  
sequence can be identified with the paths of the tree. So spreads are  
essentially species of choice sequences sharing a law restriction.  
Although in the contemporary literature one often reduces the notion of  
spread to that of species, spreads were originally introduced by Brouwer  
as primitive mathematical objects. To be exact, a spread is defined by a  
spread law and a complementary law. We shall now see that the  
former serves to determine the admissible finite sequences of natural  
numbers and the latter is used to map them to other mathematical  
objects.

The spread law classifies finite sequences into admissible and  
inadmissible. This law dictates the overall structure of the spread with  
an exhaustive account of all different admissible ways the finite  
sequences of natural numbers keep growing in time. Because it is  
exhaustive, it is possible to decide when a finite sequence is  
admissible or not, meaning that the excluded middle actually holds for  
finite sequences as far as the spread law is concerned. Moreover, the  
spread law always begins by including the empty sequence $⟨⟩⟨⟩$ as admissible and from  
then on proceeds by determining what its admissible extensions are.  
We say that the finite sequence $⟨n1,…,nk,n⟩⟨n1,…,nk,n⟩$ is an extension of the finite sequence  
$⟨n1,…,nk⟩⟨n1,…,nk⟩$. So,  
to sum up, every spread law has to satisfy the following four  
conditions:

1. the empty sequence is admissible;
2. either a finite sequence is admissible or not  
	admissible;
3. at least one extension of an admissible sequence is  
	admissible;
4. no extension of an inadmissible sequence is admissible.

The complementary law assigns mathematical objects to the non-empty  
finite admissible sequences. In effect, it maps numeric choice sequences  
to choice sequences of elements of some species. For example, recall  
that in the construction of the continuum sketched above we work with  
choice sequences of rational numbers. Given that the species of real  
number generators is actually treated as a spread, as we already  
explained, in this case the complementary law assigns rational numbers  
to the non-empty finite sequences. Roughly, if the spread law provides  
an endoskeleton that supports the spread, the complementary law supplies  
the body tissue that reveals how it looks like. Spreads with only a  
spread law are called naked and those with a complementary law are  
called dressed. For example, the so-called  
“universal spread” is a naked spread of all finite sequences of natural  
numbers. It can be helpful to illustrate its tree structure  
diagrammatically. We start from the empty sequence as the root and then  
include its admissible extensions as its nodes:

The species of real number generators mentioned above is an example  
of a dressed spread. But for a more concrete example, consider the  
spread of binary sequences. The spread law specifies that  
for every admissible sequence $⟨b1,…,bk⟩⟨b1,…,bk⟩$, there are exactly two extensions $⟨b1,…,bk,0⟩⟨b1,…,bk,0⟩$ and  
$⟨b1,…,bk,1⟩⟨b1,…,bk,1⟩$.  
The complementary law maps the sequence $⟨b1,…,bk⟩⟨b1,…,bk⟩$ to its last  
binary digit $bkbk$. The spread can  
thus be visualized as follows:

Finally, what does it mean for a choice sequence $αα$ to be an element of a spread $MM$? We write $α∈Mα∈M$ iff for every $nn$, the complementary law assigns $α(n)α(n)$ to an admissible sequence. In  
the simpler case of naked spreads, $α∈Mα∈M$ iff for every $nn$,  
$––α(n)α―(n)$ is admissible.  
It should be noted this treatment of membership is just a particular  
case of species membership.

#### Fan

Fans are finitary spreads. Informally speaking, the paths along the  
tree structure of a fan remain infinite, but the tree admits only finite  
branching. The spread of binary sequences illustrated above is an  
example of a fan. Note also that the binary fan has uncountably  
infinitely many infinite paths in the form of all sequences of zeros and  
ones. So despite the finite branching, fans need not even have a  
countable number of paths. We may characterize a fan as a spread that  
imposes an additional requirement that, for every admissible sequence,  
the spread law specifies that only a finite number of extensions is  
admissible.

One of the most important results in intuitionism is the so-called  
“fan theorem”. It can be understood as the intuitionistic counterpart of  
König’s lemma in classical graph theory, which states that if there is  
no finite upper bound to the paths of a finitely branching tree then the  
tree has at least one infinite path. Classically, its contrapositive  
thus states that if every path in a finitely branching tree is finite  
then there exists a longest finite path. That is precisely what the fan  
theorem says in intuitionistic mathematics, except that “there exists”  
must be interpreted constructively and the context is transposed to  
fans. One difficulty is that, strictly speaking, the intuitionist cannot  
have a finite path in a fan, since every path in a spread is identified  
with a choice sequence and is thus infinite. To make sense of the idea  
that a path terminates in another way, Brouwer introduced the concept of  
a bar. Simply put, a bar $RR$ is a  
species of “nodes” such that each path in a spread $MM$ is intersected. To be exact, $RR$ is a bar if every choice sequence  
in $MM$ has some initial segment of  
some length in $RR$: 
$$
∀α∈M∃n––α(n)∈R.∀α∈M∃nα―(n)∈R.
$$

Since the bar associates every choice sequence with a number, it in  
essence simulates some kind of oracle device telling us the lengths  
where the paths terminate. This captures the intuition that a finitely  
branching tree is finite. That is what a barred fan is. Now, in this  
intuitionistic terminology, we can express the idea that the fan has a  
finite path, namely, the consequent of König’s lemma, if we can  
determine a length such that every choice sequence in $MM$ has initial segment no longer than this  
length in $RR$: 
$$
∃m∀α∈M∃n(n≤m∧––α(n)∈R).∃m∀α∈M∃n(n≤m∧α―(n)∈R).
$$

We are now in a position to state the fan theorem:

**Theorem 1** (Fan theorem). *Let $MM$ be a fan and $RR$ be a species of finite sequences. If  
every $α∈Mα∈M$ has an initial  
segment of length $nn$ in $RR$, then there exists a longest  
length $mm$ such that every $α∈Mα∈M$ has an initial segment no  
longer than $mm$ in $RR$: \\\[\\begin{aligned}  
\\tag{FT} \\label{FT}  
(\\forall \\alpha \\in M \\exists n \\overline{\\alpha}(n) \\in R) \\to  
\\  
% \\forall u (u \\in R \\lor u \\notin R) \\to \\  
(\\exists m \\forall \\alpha \\in M \\exists n (n \\leq m \\land  
\\overline{\\alpha}(n) \\in R)).*

*\\end{aligned}\\\]*

But how is the fan theorem proved? The classical proof of König’s  
lemma makes use of an intuitionistically invalid inductive argument to  
show the existence of $mm$. The  
intuitionist must therefore appeal to a different argument. The proof of  
the fan theorem relies on an original argument known as the principle of  
bar induction. It can be stated without loss of generality for the  
universal spread $MM$. Let $AA$ be a subspecies of admissible sequences  
of $MM$. Call $AA$ upward hereditary if when every  
extension by one element of a finite sequence is in $AA$ then so is the finite sequence itself.  
In the unrestricted form conceived by Brouwer, the principle of bar  
induction states that, if $RR$ is a  
bar, $RR$ is a subspecies of $AA$, and $AA$ is upward hereditary, then the empty  
sequence belongs to $AA$: 
$$
\begin{aligned} \tag{BI} \label{BI} &(\forall \alpha \in M \exists n \overline{\alpha}(n) \in R \land \\ %& \quad \forall u (u \in R \lor u \notin R) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \to u \in A) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (\forall n (u \cdot \langle n \rangle \in A) \to u \in A)) \to \langle \rangle \in A. \end{aligned}\begin{aligned} \tag{BI} \label{BI} &(\forall \alpha \in M \exists n \overline{\alpha}(n) \in R \land \\ %& \quad \forall u (u \in R \lor u \notin R) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \to u \in A) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (\forall n (u \cdot \langle n \rangle \in A) \to u \in A)) \to \langle \rangle \in A. \end{aligned}
$$

In the above formula, $u⋅⟨n⟩u⋅⟨n⟩$ denotes the extension of a finite sequence $uu$ by one element  $nn$. It helps to think of $AA$ as the species of those finite  
sequences for which we can find the length required by the consequent of  
the fan theorem. Indeed, the proof proceeds by instantiating $AA$ with such a species ${u∣∃m∀α∈M∃n(n<m∧––α(n)∈R)∧∃ku=α(k)}{u∣∃m∀α∈M∃n(n<m∧α―(n)∈R)∧∃ku=α(k)}$.

Another key result in intuitionistic mathematics goes by the name of  
the “bar theorem”. The fan theorem can be easily confused with this  
theorem because it is also a result about bars. In fact, the bar theorem  
is simply the statement that bar induction holds. It should be noted  
that in bar induction the restriction that the spread must be finitary  
is dropped. So bar induction is maintained not just for fans but spreads  
in general. Brouwer originally derived the fan theorem using the  
principle of bar induction as a corollary of the bar theorem. The proof  
of the bar theorem is presented in three different articles.  
His proofs have been extensively studied because they inaugurate a  
proof-theoretic method of analysis of the structure of canonical proofs.  
The bar theorem has even found applications in repairing Gentzen’s  
original proof of the consistency of arithmetic. But a careful study  
would be outside the scope of this introductory article. We refer the  
reader to,, and for more on Brouwer’s proof and  
to for  
connections with Gentzen’s original consistency proof.

It should be emphasized, however, that the principle ([\[BI\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#BI)) originally  
formulated by Brouwer turns out to be false intuitionistically. In this  
unrestricted form, bar induction implies a quantified version of the law  
of excluded middle and thus, as it can be inferred from [1.2.1.1](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#continuity), it must be inconsistent with  
the continuity principle. To fix this, Kleene proposes that we add an  
additional requirement that $RR$ is  
decidable: 
$$
\begin{aligned} \tag{$\text{BI}_\text{D}$} &(\forall \alpha \in M \exists n \overline{\alpha}(n) \in R \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \lor u \notin R) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \to u \in A) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (\forall n (u \cdot \langle n \rangle \in A) \to u \in A)) \to \langle \rangle \in A. \end{aligned}\begin{aligned} \tag{$\text{BI}_\text{D}$} &(\forall \alpha \in M \exists n \overline{\alpha}(n) \in R \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \lor u \notin R) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \to u \in A) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (\forall n (u \cdot \langle n \rangle \in A) \to u \in A)) \to \langle \rangle \in A. \end{aligned}
$$

argues that the decidability condition is implicit in Brouwer’s  
earlier proofs from 1924 and 1927, though not in the 1954 proof. Another  
intuitionistically valid formulation introduces a requirement of  
monotonicity. $RR$ is monotonic if the  
fact that $u∈Ru∈R$ and $vv$ is an extension of $uu$, $u⪯vu⪯v$, implies that $v∈Rv∈R$:  
$$
\begin{aligned} \tag{$\text{BI}_\text{M}$} &(\forall \alpha \in M \exists n \overline{\alpha}(n) \in R \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \land u \preceq v \to v \in R) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \to u \in A) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (\forall n (u \cdot \langle n \rangle \in A) \to u \in A)) \to \langle \rangle \in A. \end{aligned}\begin{aligned} \tag{$\text{BI}_\text{M}$} &(\forall \alpha \in M \exists n \overline{\alpha}(n) \in R \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \land u \preceq v \to v \in R) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (u \in R \to u \in A) \land \\ & \quad \forall u (\forall n (u \cdot \langle n \rangle \in A) \to u \in A)) \to \langle \rangle \in A. \end{aligned}
$$

Brouwer’s “proof” of the bar theorem is not actually a proof. Surely,  
it must be erroneous since the unrestricted form of bar induction used  
does not hold intuitionistically. But even if we correctly derive the  
bar theorem from decidable or monotonic bar induction, these principles  
are no less in need of justification than the statement to be proved.  
Still, despite its mathematical shortcomings, Brouwer’s argument remains  
philosophically significant in that it serves to shed light on the  
intuitive content of the bar theorem. Before we conclude our  
discussion of Brouwer’s views, we should remark that the fan and bar  
theorems were primarily motivated by him as tools to prove the uniform  
continuity theorem, which states that every total real function is  
uniformly continuous. This is an even stronger counterexample than the  
continuity result mentioned in [1.2.1.1](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#continuity).  
Finally, we note that the fan theorem is incompatible with Church’s  
thesis.

## The creating subject

Intuitionism is the product of the activity of the creating subject,  
an idealized mind carrying out constructions and experiencing truths at  
discrete stages of time. starts introducing in print arguments  
relying on the creating subject to construct weak and strong  
counterexamples to classical principles based on the solvability of open  
problems. Such arguments are ultimately grounded in Brouwer’s conception  
of truth, according to which a proposition is true if it has been  
experienced by the creating subject:

> \[…\] *truth* is only in *reality* i.e. in the present  
> and past experiences of consciousness. Amongst these are things,  
> qualities of things, emotions, rules (state rules, cooperation rules,  
> game rules) and deeds (material deeds, deeds of thought, mathematical  
> deeds). But expected experiences, and experiences attributed to others  
> are true only as anticipations and hypotheses; in their contents there  
> is no truth.

> At this stage \[of introspection of a mental construction\] the  
> question whether a meaningful mathematical assertion is correct or  
> incorrect, is freed of any recourse to forces independent of the  
> thinking subject (such as the external world, mutual understanding, or  
> axioms which are not inner experience) and becomes exclusively a matter  
> of individual consciousness of the subject. Correctness of an assertion  
> then has no other meaning than that its content has in fact appeared in  
> the consciousness of the subject.

> \[…\] in mathematics no truths could be recognized which had not been  
> experienced \[…\]

There has been much debate about the exact nature of the creating  
subject. Brouwer is frequently accused of psychologism, subjectivism, or  
even solipsism. defends Brouwer against the  
charges of psychologism and subjectivism by maintaining that the  
creating subject is a transcendental subject in Kant’s sense. The  
transcendence is hinted at in passages such as the above, where Brouwer  
stresses that all our physical and psychological limitations as human  
subjects are abstracted away, such as our finite lifespan, imperfect  
memory, mental state, mathematical proficiency. Although Brouwer does  
argue against the plurality of minds, Placek notes that there  
is still some room left for intersubjectivity, which allows for the  
possibility of communication with other minds equally equipped with all  
the cognitive structure assumed by Brouwer.

There is also some dispute as to whether the transcendental status of  
Brouwer’s creating subject is better understood from Kant’s or Husserl’s  
perspective. Perhaps because of the way Brouwer himself explicitly  
acknowledges his debt to Kant, the received view is the Kantian  
interpretation assumed by. Similarities between  
Brouwer and Kant in the context of their transcendental philosophies are  
most systematically drawn by.  
At the same time, however, there are other similarities between Brouwer  
and Husserl that are just as difficult to ignore. Drawing from the  
phenomenology of inner-time awareness, argues that Brouwer’s creating  
subject is best analyzed using [Husserl’s phenomenology](https://iep.utm.edu/huss-int/).  
Further connections between Brouwer’s intuitionism and Husserl’s  
phenomenology have been explored especially by,  
and.  
We will see in [2.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#heytingmeaning) that this phenomenological  
interpretation of intuitionism is originated by the meaning explanations  
advanced by Heyting in terms of fulfillments of intentions.

#### Creating subject argument

It is time to return to the creating subject arguments.  
Brouwer realized that the way the creating subject experiences truths  
about open problems could be used to define choice sequences and  
generate counterexamples to emphasize the elements of indeterminacy in  
intuitionistic analysis. To see how this can be done, it might be  
instructive to examine a simple argument used by Brouwer as a weak  
counterexample to $∀r∈R(r≠0→r>0∨r<0)∀r∈R(r≠0→r>0∨r<0)$. We say that a proposition $AA$ is testable if the instance of the weak  
law of excluded middle $¬A∨¬¬A¬A∨¬¬A$ holds. Given a proposition $AA$ not known to be testable, Brouwer  
maintains that the creating subject can construct a choice sequence  
$αα$ of rationals by making the  
following choices:

- if during the choice of $α(n)α(n)$ the creating subject has  
	neither experienced the truth of $AA$  
	nor its absurdity then choose $α(n)=0α(n)=0$;
- if as soon as between the choice of $α(k−1)α(k−1)$ and $α(k)α(k)$, the creating subject has  
	experienced the truth of $AA$ then  
	choose $α(k+n)=2−kα(k+n)=2−k$ for  
	every $nn$;
- if as soon as between the choice of $α(k−1)α(k−1)$ and $α(k)α(k)$, the creating subject has  
	experienced the absurdity of $AA$ then  
	choose $α(k+n)=−2−kα(k+n)=−2−k$ for  
	every $nn$.

Let us introduce some notation to make this definition a bit more  
mathematically precise. Brouwer’s tenet that “there are no  
non-experienced truths” can be understood as saying that, if a  
proposition $AA$ is true, then it is  
not possible that there is no stage at which the creating subject is  
going to experience the truth of $AA$.  
In the presence of a special notation $Unknown node type: imgnAUnknown node type: imgnA$ to express that “the creating subject has experienced the  
truth of $AA$ at stage $nn$ ”, then this fundamental tenet can be  
put into symbolic notation as: 
$$
A→¬¬∃nUnknown node type: imgnA.A→¬¬∃nUnknown node type: imgnA.
$$
 The above definition can then be more  
rigorously stated as:

$$
α(n)=⎧⎪
⎪⎨⎪
⎪⎩0if ¬Unknown node type: imgn(A∨¬A)2−kfor all n≥k if Unknown node type: imgkA and ¬Unknown node type: imgk−1(A∨¬A)−2−kfor all n≥k if Unknown node type: imgk¬A and ¬Unknown node type: imgk−1(A∨¬A).α(n)={0if ¬Unknown node type: imgn(A∨¬A)2−kfor all n≥k if Unknown node type: imgkA and ¬Unknown node type: imgk−1(A∨¬A)−2−kfor all n≥k if Unknown node type: imgk¬A and ¬Unknown node type: imgk−1(A∨¬A).
$$

$αα$ is convergent and thus a  
real-number generator. Yet, the real number $rr$ generated by $αα$ cannot be $00$ because that would lead to a  
contradiction. If that were the case, $α(n)=0α(n)=0$ for all $nn$, meaning that $∀n¬Unknown node type: imgn(A∨¬A)∀n¬Unknown node type: imgn(A∨¬A)$.  
Intuitionistically, the De Morgan law $(∀xϕ(x))→(¬∃x¬ϕ(x))(∀xϕ(x))→(¬∃x¬ϕ(x))$ and contraposition $(ϕ→ψ)→(¬ψ→¬ϕ)(ϕ→ψ)→(¬ψ→¬ϕ)$ are valid schemes. We  
refer the reader to the appendix for more information. The contradiction  
$¬A∧¬¬A¬A∧¬¬A$ follows  
from the contrapositive of Brouwer’s tenet, $¬∃nUnknown node type: imgn(A∨¬A)→¬(A∨¬A)¬∃nUnknown node type: imgn(A∨¬A)→¬(A∨¬A)$. This shows that $r≠0r≠0$. Yet, if $r>0r>0$,  
there is a $kk$ such that $α(n)=2−kα(n)=2−k$ and thus the truth of  
$AA$ has been experienced,  
contradicting our assumption that $AA$  
is not known to be testable. Since the same can be said mutatis mutandis  
for $r<0r<0$, we have established  
that $r<0∨r>0r<0∨r>0$ does  
not hold. For an overview of this and other examples given by Brouwer,  
see.

Creating subject arguments tend to be seen as a controversial aspect  
of intuitionism because it is not clear how they qualify as mathematical  
arguments. In spite of the doubts  
surrounding them, they have been studied in the literature and different  
formalizations have been offered to make precise the assumptions  
underlying them. We conclude this section by presenting the two most  
influential proposals:

##### Kripke’s Schema:

$$
∃α((¬A↔∀nα(n)=0)∧(∃nα(n)≠0→A)).(KS)(KS)∃α((¬A↔∀nα(n)=0)∧(∃nα(n)≠0→A)).
$$

This schema was proposed by Kripke in a letter to Kreisel around  
1965\. This letter  
led Kreisel to formulate the theory of the creating subject to be seen  
soon. The schema is intended to describe the generation of a choice  
sequence $αα$ out of the truth or  
absurdity of a proposition $AA$  
experienced by the creative subject. Though Kripke originally formulated  
it in what is known as its weak form, there is a stronger and simpler  
form:

$$
∃α(A↔∃nα(n)=1).(KS+)(KS+)∃α(A↔∃nα(n)=1).
$$

stresses that both schemes are present in Brouwer’s published  
work.

**The theory of the creating subject:**
$$
\begin{aligned} \forall n (\Box_n A \lor \neg \Box_n A) \label{cs1} \tag{CS1} \\ \forall n (\Box_n A \to \Box_{n+m} A) \label{cs2} \tag{CS2} \\ \forall n (\Box_n A \to A) \label{cs3} \tag{CS3} \\ A \to \neg \neg \exists n \Box_n A. \label{cs4} \tag{CS4} \end{aligned}\begin{aligned} \forall n (\Box_n A \lor \neg \Box_n A) \label{cs1} \tag{CS1} \\ \forall n (\Box_n A \to \Box_{n+m} A) \label{cs2} \tag{CS2} \\ \forall n (\Box_n A \to A) \label{cs3} \tag{CS3} \\ A \to \neg \neg \exists n \Box_n A. \label{cs4} \tag{CS4} \end{aligned}
$$

The theory of the creating subject was originally proposed by and subsequently  
refined by. In their expositions they  
employ a turnstile notation to represent the creating subject and omit  
the universal quantifiers. The modal notation used here is introduced  
by. The four  
axioms above emphasize that the creating subject continuously performs  
their mental activities one after another at stages of time. ([\[cs1\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#cs1))  
states that $Unknown node type: imgnAUnknown node type: imgnA$ is decidable  
at every stage $nn$, for the creating  
subject either experiences a truth or not. ([\[cs2\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#cs2)) expresses that  
truths experienced in past stages are never forgotten at subsequent  
stages. ([\[cs3\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#cs3)) encapsulates the plausible principle  
that experienced truths are indeed truths. At any stage $nn$, if the creating subject has  
experienced the truth of $AA$, then  
$AA$ is true. ([\[cs4\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#cs4)) axiom  
expresses the already familiar tenet discussed before. Importantly, ([\[wks\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#wks)) is  
derivable from these four axioms. ([\[sks\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#sks)) can be derived  
with the strengthening of ([\[cs4\]](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#cs4)) proposed by: 
$$
A↔∃nUnknown node type: imgnA.(CS4+)(CS4+)A↔∃nUnknown node type: imgnA.
$$

## Heyting

Although Brouwer downplays the roles of logic and language in his  
intuitionism, the development of intuitionistic logic by his student  
Arend Heyting and others has ironically made intuitionism more  
accessible and generated a growing interest. Historically,  
intuitionistic logic came into being when the Dutch Mathematics Society  
held a contest involving the formalization of intuitionistic logic and  
mathematics, and developed the first full  
axiomatization of intuitionistic first-order logic by isolating the set  
of intuitionistically acceptable axioms of *Principia  
Mathematica*. Heyting begins the undertaking with the following  
remark that echoes Brouwer’s attitude about language:

> Intuitionistic mathematics is a mental activity, and for it every  
> language, including the formalistic one, is only a tool of  
> communication. It is in principle impossible to set up a system of  
> formulas that would be equivalent to intuitionistic mathematics, for the  
> possibilities of thought cannot be reduced to a finite number of rules  
> set up in advance.

Perhaps because of Brouwer’s tendency towards anti-formalism, there  
is a popular narrative that his initial reaction to Heyting’s  
formalization work was negative. However, in reality Brouwer was very  
pleasantly surprised. This survey article will not  
delve into intuitionistic logic and its formal developments. Instead, we  
refer the interested reader to the appendix for a list of notable  
theorems in intuitionistic logic and classical theorems that turn out  
unprovable within intuitionistic logic. Our focus is on the  
philosophical views that underlie Heyting’s presentation of  
intuitionistic mathematics. While they continued to be true to the  
spirit of his teacher’s intuitionism as a mental creation independent of  
language, his thought has evolved in many interesting directions. His  
liberalism and anti-metaphysics, meaning explanations for the logical  
connectives, and hierarchy of grades of evidence are some major  
contributions worth stressing.

## Intuitionism without philosophical subtleties

Perhaps the most relevant contrast in attitude is that Brouwer is a  
strong mathematical revisionist that sees classical mathematics as  
unjustified. Without making compromises, Brouwer was determined to make  
intuitionism prevail over formalism., on the other hand,  
expresses a more liberal stance in the foundational debate, and is even  
willing to see intuitionistic mathematics as standing alongside  
classical mathematics. He is interested in promoting intuitionism so  
that working mathematicians could engage with its practice and not in  
witnessing the end of classical mathematics. In order to popularize  
intuitionism and minimize conflict with formalists, Heyting decided to  
present it as a simple program that banishes metaphysics from  
mathematics.

Brouwer’s own account of intuitionism is actually inseparable from a  
mystical perspective towards life that supports the intuition of twoity.  
This rather arcane doctrine states how consciousness moves away from its  
deepest home to the exterior world of the subject. The reader can refer  
to for an  
easy-to-follow overview of it. Given that these mythicist elements  
understandably tend to unsettle mathematicians, it is hardly surprising  
that these ideas are largely marginalized in Heyting’s work. Heyting  
emphasizes that to properly understand intuitionistic mathematics we do  
not need to adhere to this peculiar “psychological theory concerning the  
origination of knowledge”:

> Brouwer’s explanations are incorporated in an exposition of his views  
> on science in general and of an all-embracing conception of life and the  
> world. Fortunately, in order to understand intuitionistic mathematics,  
> it is not necessary to adhere to philosophic and psychological theories.  

Heyting also dismisses the Kantian roots of intuitionism. Like  
Brouwer, Heyting stresses that intuitionism is an activity rather than a  
doctrine. It thus cannot be adequately described by means of a set of  
premises. Heyting sees this as reason to avoid looking for a basis for  
intuitionistic mathematics within some form of Kantian philosophical  
framework. He thinks the foundations of intuitionism should be erected  
on simple ordinary concepts that do not require any definite  
metaphysical considerations. For Heyting, intuitionism does not stand as  
a philosophical system on par with “realism, idealism, or  
existentialism”. In his view “the only philosophical thesis of  
mathematical intuitionism is that no philosophy is needed to understand  
mathematics”. One might wonder how he  
may retain the mind-dependence of mathematical objects and truths  
without committing intuitionistic mathematics to a form of mathematical  
idealism. As we shall see, his answer seems to be that to practice  
intuitionism we do not need to pay attention to such questions.

Despite the rejection of any kind of philosophical system, Heyting  
still maintains the view that the intuition of twoity is the starting  
point of intuitionistic mathematics. The “two fundamental facts” of the  
“mental conception of an abstract entity, and that of an indefinite  
repetition of the conception of entities” is described not as part of a  
theory of knowledge but as a natural phenomenon of our daily lives.  
Everyone “knows how to build up mentally the natural numbers” from these  
two concepts and “knows what it means that their sequence can be made to  
proceed indefinitely”. Heyting stresses that the  
considerations about intuition are not metaphysical per se, for in  
intuitionistic mathematics we do not need to inquire how these two  
fundamental concepts are obtained:

> They become so if one tries to build up a theory about them, e.g., to  
> answer the question whether we form the notion of an entity by  
> abstraction from actual perceptions of objects, or if, on the contrary,  
> the notion of an entity must be present in our mind in order to enable  
> us to perceive an object apart from the rest of the world. But such  
> questions have nothing to do with mathematics. We simply state the fact  
> that the concepts of an abstract entity and of a sequence of such  
> entities are clear to every normal human being, even to young  
> children.

## The meaning explanations of the intuitionistic logical constants

Brouwer viewed logic as a mere part of mathematics, never paying much  
attention to the study of intuitionistic logic as an independent  
discipline. He entrusted this task to Heyting, limiting himself to only  
a few scattered remarks on the proper interpretation of the  
intuitionistic logical connectives and the intuitionistic nature of  
truth in his work. In essence, according to intuitionism, a subject may  
only claim that a proposition is true when a construction required by  
the proposition has been carried out. Since truth requires an  
“introspective realization” of a mathematical construction, no  
subject-independent notion of truth is recognized in intuitionistic  
mathematics.

There was a heated debate in the twenties about the nature of  
intuitionistic logic, including contributions by Glivenko, Barzin and  
Errera, and others. Heyting developed in a series of papers his “meaning  
explanations” to address questions about the meaning of expressions  
occurring in a formal system of intuitionistic logic.  
The meaning explanations serve as an informal semantics that endows  
every compound mathematical proposition formed by the intuitionistic  
logical connectives with meaning by establishing the intended  
interpretation of these connectives. It has led to the consolidation of  
what is today known as the [BHK  
explanation](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#SH1c) of the logical connectives. The acronym is  
a reference to its originators, Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov. Note  
that sometimes this explanation is described as an interpretation  
instead. There are good reasons to avoid this terminology since  
interpretations are commonly associated with formal semantics. The  
constructions that realize the truth of a propositions can be informally  
regarded as proofs. For this reason, the BHK explanation is also known  
as the proof explanation as well:

1. a proof of $A∧BA∧B$ is a  
	pair containing a proof of $AA$ and a  
	proof of $BB$;
2. a proof of $A∨BA∨B$ is a  
	either a proof of $AA$ or a proof of  
	$BB$, plus the information of whether  
	the left or right disjunct is the one being proved;
3. a proof of $A→BA→B$ is a  
	method that transforms any proof of $AA$ into a proof of $BB$;
4. a proof of $⊥⊥$ is not  
	possible; $¬A¬A$ is defined as  
	$A→⊥A→⊥$;
5. a proof of $∀x∈AB(x)∀x∈AB(x)$ is a method that transforms any $x∈Ax∈A$ into a proof of $B(x)B(x)$;
6. a proof of $∃x∈AB(x)∃x∈AB(x)$ is a pair containing an $x∈Ax∈A$ and a proof of $B(x)B(x)$.

By themselves these conditions have no explanatory power as a formal  
semantics. Whether or not they can invalidate the law of excluded  
middle, for example, depends on a concrete interpretation of “proof” and  
“method”. Note also  
that the domain of quantification is a species. It can be omitted when  
the species is simple enough that $x∈Ax∈A$ does not require a proof and we know the domain that $BB$ ranges over. We did this in formulas  
about numbers or numeric sequences in [1.2](https://iep.utm.edu/intuitionism-in-mathematics/#secondact). But  
even when this is not made explicit, quantification is always restricted  
to a domain. Intuitionism sees the totality of mathematical  
constructions as open-ended. It cannot make sense of an  
unrestricted quantification over all mathematical objects.

It is important to distinguish the BHK explanation as presented above  
from Heyting’s own original ideas advanced in his meaning explanations.  
It is especially worth noting that he says nothing about the intuition  
of twoity. One might think that this is related to his general aversion  
to intricate philosophical considerations. Yet, in his explanations  
Heyting does borrow key concepts from [Husserl’s theory of  
intentionality](https://iep.utm.edu/huss-int/). This connection was first emphasized by and. By  
interpreting proofs of propositions as fulfillments of intentions,  
Heyting alludes to the view of proofs as objects of intuition in  
Husserl’s sense. This suggests that the meaning explanations are  
elucidated in terms of intuition in the phenomenological sense of  
intentional fulfillments:

> A mathematical proposition expresses a certain expectation; e.g. the  
> proposition “The Euler constant $CC$  
> is rational” means the expectation that one can find two integers $aa$ and $bb$ in such a way that $C=a/bC=a/b$. Perhaps the word “intention”  
> coined by the phenomenologists expresses even better what is meant here  
> than the word “expectation”. I also use the word “proposition” for the  
> intention expressed by the proposition. \[…\] The assertion of a  
> proposition means the fulfillment of the intention, e.g. the assertion  
> “ $CC$ is rational” would mean that one  
> has actually found the wanted integers.

Unfortunately, Heyting does not say much more about the idea. But  
since then connections between intuitionism and phenomenology have been  
extensively explored in the literature. This propositions-as-intentions  
explanation in particular has been further extended by to  
accommodate intuitions of natural numbers and finite sets and by  
to justify choice sequences as objects of intuition. It has also been  
severely criticized due to incompatibilities between Husserl’s strong  
platonist tendencies and other idealist aspects of Brouwer’s  
thought. Recently, a  
stronger objection that, even if we overlook these tensions,  
propositions cannot be intentions and proofs cannot be fulfillments, has  
been raised: while intentions have to be directed to a unique object and  
can only be fulfilled with their presence, propositions, such as  
disjunctions and existential statements, can have different proofs.

Another significant contrast is that, as observed by, the term “proof”  
does not systematically appear in Heyting’s meaning explanations.  
Although in the BHK explanation the notion of provability is employed in  
every condition, Heyting himself only introduces proofs in his  
explanation of the clause for implication, writing that $A→BA→B$ means the intention of a  
construction which leads from every proof of $AA$ to a proof of $BB$. Even so, a proof of a proposition is  
explained as the realization of the construction required by it, a  
mathematical construction which can itself be treated  
mathematically (Heyting, p.14;, p.114).  
That is, provability is not accepted as a primitive notion. This  
suggests that, in contrast to the formulation of the BHK explanation  
given above, proofs does not play a central semantic role in Heyting’s  
view. For him, proofs can be seen to receive their Brouwerian reduction  
to mental constructions given in intuiton through their identification  
with intentional fulfillments. One difficulty with this strategy is that  
proofs are treated as objects, while fulfillments are mental processes.  
  
argues that the objectification of a mental process can be achieved  
through an act of reflection, a higher-order intentional act that one  
directs at one’s own intentional experiences.

Heyting rejects the rather widespread explanation of “ $AA$ is true” as “ $AA$ is provable”. He sees the latter as  
equivalent to the phrase “there exists a proof of $AA$ ”, which implies the idea of  
mind-transcendent existence of proofs. Intuitionistically, truth is  
understood as the establishment of an “empirical fact” about realization  
of expectations or fulfillment of intentions. It does not have to do  
with a state-of-affairs, but only with one’s own experiences. To assert  
the truth of a proposition $AA$ is  
thus to maintain “we know how to prove $AA$ ”.

## The hierarchy of grades of evidence

Brouwer developed intuitionism as a response to the paradoxes of set  
theory, ensuring that every theorem possesses intuitive content to  
guarantee the absence of contradictions. But for Heyting not even in  
intuitionistic mathematics can we achieve absolute certainty. He  
proposed a hierarchy that classifies what is intuitively clear in a  
descending order:

> It has proved not to be intuitively clear what is intuitively clear  
> in mathematics. It is even possible to construct a descending scale of  
> grades of evidence. The highest grade is that of such assertions as  
> $2+2=42+2=4$. $1002+2=10041002+2=1004$ belongs to a lower grade; we show this not by  
> actual counting, but by a reasoning which shows that in general $(n+2)+2=n+4(n+2)+2=n+4$. Such general  
> statements about natural numbers belong to a next grade. They have  
> already the character of an implication: ‘If a natural number $nn$ is constructed, then we can effect the  
> construction, expressed by $(n+2)+2=n+4(n+2)+2=n+4$ ’. This level is formalized in the free-variable  
> calculus. I shall not try to arrange the other levels in a linear order;  
> it will suffice to mention some notions which by their introduction  
> lower the grade of evidence.
> 
> 1. The notion of the order type $ωω$, as it occurs in the definition of  
> 	constructible ordinals.
> 2. The notion of negation, which involves a hypothetical  
> 	construction which is shown afterwards to be impossible.
> 3. The theory of quantification. The interpretation of the  
> 	quantifiers themselves is not problematical, but the use of quantified  
> 	expressions in logical formulas is.
> 4. The introduction of infinitely proceeding sequences (choice  
> 	sequences, arbitrary, functions).
> 5. The notion of a species, which suffers from the indefiniteness of  
> 	the notion of a property. The natural numbers form a species; all  
> 	species do not. It is doubtful whether all species of natural numbers  
> 	form a species; therefore I prefer not to use this notion.

Let us go over his hierarchy from the highest to the lowest grades of  
evidence. First, we have particular propositions about small numbers.  
They have the highest grade because they are immediately evident. The second  
highest grade of evidence is that of particular propositions about  
larger numbers. Heyting maintains that there is loss in evidence because  
they tend to be demonstrated as instances of a general rule. For  
example, when asked to show that $135664+37863=37863+135664135664+37863=37863+135664$ most people will appeal to the fact that  
$n+m=m+nn+m=m+n$ for every $nn$ and $mm$ instead of counting. The third highest  
grade of evidence is that of such general numeric propositions. The  
issue at stake here is that such a general proposition has a  
hypothetical nature. Heyting does not elaborate, but the fact that  
general numeric propositions cannot be verified by calculation and need  
to be proved by induction presumably has to do with the loss of  
evidence. What about the lowest grade described in (1)–(5)? Heyting  
follows in admitting that we descend  
into an even lower grade when we introduce negations, since the  
implication is less certain when the hypothetical constructions cannot  
be carried out. He also mentions the theory of quantification, but since  
general propositions have already been placed one level above, it is not  
entirely clear what kind of propositions he has in mind. Infinity is  
also found at the bottom of the hierarchy in the form of the  
introduction of $ωω$ and choice  
sequences. Heyting places the notion of species in the lowest grade, for  
there is no precise definition of what a property is. Note that each one  
of these represent a different and incomparable lowest grade.

## Dummett

Mental constructions in intuition play a key role in the writings of  
Brouwer and Heyting. [Dummett’s seminal  
work](https://iep.utm.edu/michael-dummett/#SH2b) marked a notable departure from their tradition. Restricting  
his attention to only logic and not all of intuitionistic mathematics,  
he wishes to justify the rejection of classical logic in favor of  
intuitionistic logic. This is done by means of an original  
meaning-theoretic argument where intuition is replaced by provability as  
the fundamental notion that grounds meaning and truth. More  
generally, unlike Brouwer and Heyting, Dummett denies the  
mind-independence of mathematical objects and truths without maintaining  
their mind-dependence. This position leads to an intuitionism without  
intuition that subscribes only to anti-realism and not to idealism.

## The meaning-theoretic turn

For Dummett, the meaning of a sentence is manifested in is use.  
Dummett concludes from this that meaning should be given in terms of  
proof, given that in ordinary mathematical practice using a sentence  
expressing a theorem is the same as using a proof of it or at least  
recognizing such a proof when we are presented with one. Dummett’s  
program can be seen as a rearticulation of the meaning explanations  
proposed by Heyting through the late Wittgenstein’s idea that [the meaning of a word  
can be determined by its use](https://iep.utm.edu/michael-dummett/#SH2a).

Dummett forcefully rejects Brouwer’s views. Dummett sees the meaning  
of a sentence as a product of its function as an instrument for  
communication. An individual cannot assign a personal mental image to  
the meaning of a sentence that cannot be observed by its communication.  
For him explaining meaning by appealing to a subjectivist notion of  
mental construction in intuition invites the threat of solipsism. In  
fact, Dummett describes Brouwer’s philosophy as “psychologistic through  
and through”. We must understand meaning in  
terms of mind-independent verifiability conditions.

Realism violates the principle that use exhaustively determines  
meaning, for it determines meaning by truth-conditions which are in  
general not verifiable. The roots of Dummett’s rejection of realism and  
general appreciation of the intuitionistic standpoint can already be  
found in his earlier investigations about truth. The principle that meaning is use  
is perfectly consistent with the BHK explanation. Dummett observes that  
to conform with this principle we must also replace the notion of truth  
by that of proof. How should this meaning-theoretic argument for  
intuitionism analyze truth in such terms? There are two fundamental  
principles that in his view the notion of truth should satisfy:  
$$
\begin{aligned} \text{If a statement is true, there must be something in virtue of which it is true.} \tag{C} \\[1em] \text{If a statement is true, it must be in principle possible to know that it is true.} \tag{K} \end{aligned}\begin{aligned} \text{If a statement is true, there must be something in virtue of which it is true.} \tag{C} \\[1em] \text{If a statement is true, it must be in principle possible to know that it is true.} \tag{K} \end{aligned}
$$

The first principle can be traced back to classical correspondence  
theories of truth. It is also valid intuitionistically as long as the  
truth-makers are identified with proofs. The second principle requires  
commitment to anti-realism. How to satisfy these principles? This raises  
several difficult questions about existence, temporality, and  
provability which Dummett acknowledges but does not offer a conclusive  
answer for. Consider how the truth of the proposition $598017+246532=844549598017+246532=844549$, for example,  
may be verified. Dummett writes:

> We may perform the computation, and discover that $598017+246532598017+246532$ does indeed equal $844549844549$: but does that mean that the  
> equation was already true before the computation was performed, or that  
> it would have been true even if the computation had never been  
> performed? The truth-definition leaves such questions quite unanswered,  
> because it does not provide for inflections of tense or mood of the  
> predicate ‘is true’: it has been introduced only as a predicate as  
> devoid of tense as are all ordinary mathematical predicates;

Should one reduce “ $AA$ is true” to  
“ $AA$ is provable” or “ $AA$ has been proved”? This introduces in  
Dummett’s rearticulation of intuitionism what calls the distinction  
between the actualist and possibilist conceptions of truth. To endorse  
the actualist view is to introduce tense in mathematics, as Dummett  
admits, while under the possibilist view truth remains timeless just as  
it is in a classical account. We should stress that the ambiguous  
modality involved in “provable” further complicates the possibilist  
view. In his attempts to elucidate the possibility of proof existence  
involved in the account, Prawitz even goes as far as endorsing  
ontological realism for proofs. Dummett fears that allowing for the  
existence of unknown proofs in such a static mathematical reality leads  
to the validation of the excluded middle and thus cannot accept the  
proposal. Dummett does not consistently subscribe to either the  
actualist or possibilist conception in his writings. Unlike the account  
of truth envisioned by Brouwer and Heyting seen in the previous  
sections, in Dummett there is no reference to intentional content  
because truth has been desubjectivized. It is no longer, so to speak, a  
first-person notion that appeals to the creating subject, as it was  
since Brouwer, but a notion analyzed strictly from a third-person  
perspective.

One of Dummett’s major contributions to intuitionism is the  
introduction of a crucial distinction between canonical and  
non-canonical proofs. Roughly, a canonical proof has an explicit form by  
which it can be directly checked that it proves a proposition; a proof  
is non-canonical if it is not in canonical form, but an effective method  
can reduce it to a canonical proof in a finite period of time. The  
notion of proof presupposed in the [BHK  
explanation](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#SH1c) has to be limited to that of canonical proof. Clearly,  
even in intuitionistic mathematics, a proof of a conjunction $A∧BA∧B$, for example, need not consist  
in a pair of proofs of $AA$ and $BB$ explicitly. We may prove the  
conjunction indirectly, say, by modus ponens, if we have proofs $C→A∧BC→A∧B$ and $CC$ in hand. Dummett also  
contemplates connections between canonical proofs and normalized proofs  
in proof systems of natural deduction, on the one hand, and canonical  
proofs and Brouwer’s fully analyzed proofs in his proof of the bar  
theorem, on the other.

The notion of canonical proof has been instrumental in the further  
development of mathematical constructivism with the Swedish school led  
by Prawitz, Martin-Löf, and Sundholm, which pushed forward the  
meaning-theoretic approach inaugurated by Dummett in different  
directions. Prawitz founded proof-theoretic semantics as an attempt to  
convert the BHK explanation into a formal semantics complete with  
respect to intuitionistic logic. Martin-Löf  
kept the explanation informal but extended its scope to offer a  
philosophical justification for the axioms and rules of inference of his  
[constructive  
type theory](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#H5), a formal system  
developed to establish a rigorous foundation for Bishop’s brand of  
constructive mathematics. The formalism is based on a correspondence  
between propositions and types sometimes known as the [Curry–Howard  
isomorphism](https://iep.utm.edu/lambda-calculi/#H5). See for an overview of  
anti-realism in this type-theoretic tradition.

## Against the ontological route

  
argues that the meaning-theoretic argument outlined above is the only  
correct route to the justification of intuitionistic logic. Of course,  
questions of meaning were already considered to some extent in the works  
of Brouwer and Heyting. But their main focus has always been  
epistemological: their intuitionism reflects the mental activity of the  
creating subject carrying out constructions in intuition. With Dummett,  
the matter of how mathematical objects are given to us is given a  
semantic answer: what in analytic philosophy is known as Frege’s  
linguistic turn is replicated in intuitionistic mathematics.  
In other words, intuitionism ceases to be primarily a theory of  
knowledge with semantic overtones and becomes primarily a theory of  
meaning with epistemic overtones.

Part of the strength of Dummett’s meaning-theoretic turn derives from  
his rejection of another argument for intuitionistic logic that is  
ontological in nature. It starts with the doctrine that natural numbers  
are the creations of human thought. Without presupposing any  
sort of theory of meaning, he implies that we may only elucidate truth  
for decidable arithmetical statements by means of actually performed  
computations:

> \[…\] it has now become apparent that there is one way in which the  
> thesis that natural numbers are creations of the human mind might be  
> taken, namely as relating precisely to the appropriate notion of truth  
> for decidable statements of arithmetic, which would provide a ground for  
> rejecting a platonistic interpretation of number-theoretic statements  
> generally, without appeal to any general thesis concerning the notion of  
> meaning. This way of taking the thesis would amount to holding that  
> there is no notion of truth applicable even to numerical equations save  
> that in which a statement is true when we have actually performed a  
> computation (or effected a proof) which justifies that statement. Such a  
> claim must rest, as we have seen, on the most resolute scepticism  
> concerning subjunctive conditionals: it must deny that there exists any  
> proposition which is now true about what the result of a computation  
> which has not yet been performed would be if it were to be  
> performed.

The problem with this “hard-headed” view, according to Dummett, is  
that it entails a strong form of skepticism about subjunctive  
conditionals. If we can only explain truth for decidable arithmetical  
statements by appealing to actual computations, Dummett thinks we  
necessarily rule out the existence of propositions which are now true  
about the result of a yet-to-be-performed computation. For example, it  
is easy to tell now that $10100+1010=1010+1010010100+1010=1010+10100$ is true even before performing the  
calculations involved in the equation. Dummett sees ontological  
intuitionism as an unattainable position because, in his view, it must  
reject such kind of reasoning about subjunctive conditionals. One might  
resist Dummett’s argument by noting that actual computations need not  
play a decisive role in determining truth. If numbers are the creations  
of human thought, then some truth-makers of propositions may also come  
into being in time. presents an excellent reconstruction of Dummett’s  
arguments and launches a defense of the ontological route in this  
direction.

## Sense and reference

also  
considers a [sense-reference  
distinction](https://iep.utm.edu/frege/#H4) for constructive semantics. In a nutshell, the basic  
insight behind his distinction is that the sense of an expression is  
related to its reference as a program is related to its execution. That  
is, under an intuitionistic point of view, the sense of an expression  
must be an effective method for computing its reference, whereas the  
reference must be what results after the method is fully carried out.  
The idea has its roots in Dummett’s early commentaries on Frege’s own  
semantic distinction:

> Frege’s argument about identity statements would be met by supposing  
> the sense of a singular term to be related to its reference as a  
> programme to its execution, that is, if the sense provided an effective  
> procedure of physical and mental operations whereby the reference would  
> be determined.

How to implement such a distinction? Dummett classifies expressions  
in two main groups, namely, that of predicates, relational expressions,  
and logical constants, on the one hand, and that of singular terms and  
functional expressions, on the other. To specify the meaning of  
predicates, relational expressions, and logical constants we must rely  
on the notion of proof, but a semantic analysis of singular terms and  
functional expressions can be done directly without explicit mention of  
proofs.  
Predicate-like functional expressions in the Fregean sense are excluded  
from the second group. The meaning of the logical constants is fixed by  
the BHK explanation. Dummett adds that the meaning of a predicate  
consists in a means of recognizing a proof that the predicate applies to  
a given object. Dummett relates this conception of meaning to sense and  
reference as follows:

> We grasp the meaning of a predicate when we know how, for any element  
> of the domain over which it is defined, to classify mathematical  
> constructions into those that do and those that do not prove that it  
> satisfies the predicate; and just that principle of classification is  
> the semantic value of the predicate.

What we grasp when we understand a predicate is its sense. Here  
“semantic value” is simply Dummett’s word for the intuitionistic  
counterpart of reference. Dummett concludes from this that there is no  
room for a sense-reference distinction for predicates, for “the semantic  
value of the predicate and what we grasp when we understand it are one  
and the same” (p.491). He sees the problem as the explanation of the  
meaning of a predicate in terms of proofs. Given that the same can be  
said of the meaning of relational expressions and logical constants,  
there can be no distinction between sense and reference for them  
either.

What about singular terms and functional expressions? Dummett argues  
that insofar as we are dealing with natural numbers or other finitely  
presented mathematical objects, we can distinguish the sense and  
reference of their corresponding expressions. To illustrate this, he  
points out that the same natural number may be given in different ways.  
The number thirteen can be presented to us as $1313$ or $4+324+32$, for example, and the equality $13=4+3213=4+32$ may even extend our  
knowledge, if [analytic  
judgments](https://iep.utm.edu/kantview/#SH2b) are allowed to be ampliative. We may thus regard numerals  
as “aiming at natural numbers by varying routes” (p.493). Yet, we cannot  
do the same for expressions for real numbers or other not finitely given  
mathematical objects. The particular way a real number is given to us  
might affect what counts as a proof of a proposition about it. As a  
result, their sense is part of their semantic value:

> A real number, such as $ππ$, can  
> be given in different, even though provably equivalent, ways. For  
> classical mathematicians and constructivists alike, the specific way in  
> which the number $ππ$ is given  
> affects what is required for a proof of a statement about it, at least  
> until the different possible definitions have been proved equivalent;  
> that is why the sense of an expression, and not just its reference, must  
> be something common to all. In classical semantics, however, the  
> semantic value of a term denoting $ππ$ will be its contribution to what  
> determines, not what is required to prove a statement in which it  
> occurs, but its truth-value, and that is just the denotation of the  
> term, the number $ππ$ itself; that  
> is why its sense is not part of its semantic value. In a constructivist  
> meaning-theory, by contrast, the semantic value of the term is,  
> precisely, its contribution to determining what is to count as a proof  
> of any statement in which it occurs; and therefore the way in which the  
> denotation is given to us is an integral ingredient of its semantic  
> value.

These considerations also extend to functional expressions, since  
infinite sequences may be regarded as functions from the natural  
numbers. In sum, for Dummett the intuitionist cannot generally maintain  
a sense-reference distinction not even for singular terms or functional  
expressions because of the intensional treatment that infinitary objects  
receive. A more optimistic rearticulation Dummett’s semantic views is  
proposed by against the background of [constructive  
type theory](https://iep.utm.edu/constructive-mathematics/#H5).

distinction. See for a comprehensive account of

Intuitionistic logic can be roughly viewed as classical logic without  
the law of excluded middle. Below you will find a non-exhaustive list of  
some notable theorems of intuitionistic logic as well as some notable  
classical theorems that are not provable in intuitionistic logic. Some  
of them have been important enough in the literature to deserve their  
own names. Others have been grouped together under a certain theme. If  
you see an implication but not a biconditional in the intuitionistic  
theorems, it is typically because the converse fails.
