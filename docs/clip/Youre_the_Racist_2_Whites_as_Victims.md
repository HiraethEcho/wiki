[image 1 (link #1)]When people accuse some people of being a racist, they 
sometimes use a two-part strategy. First, they can deny this. They can even 
pretend they do not understand how language works or have any recollection of 
history. Second, they can accuse critics of being racists. This strategy is 
commonly used to “refute” criticism of sexism and racism. But does it have any 
merit as an argument? To assess it, I will use the principle of charity and try 
to make the best version of the argument.
 
One common opening move in the argument is to deny or downplay discrimination 
against minorities. Since I am trying to make the most plausible version of this
argument, this version will not deny that discrimination and racism did exist. 
After all, the claim is not that racism and discrimination never existed, just 
that it either does not exist now or is far less bad than critics claim.
 
When making this case, the most plausible way is to point to civil rights and 
anti-discrimination laws. And, of course, one must mention President Obama. When
critics point to modern examples of discrimination and racism, the counter is 
that while modern cases exist, they are rare. For example, one might acknowledge
that there are racist police, but they are “a few bad apples.” One might accept 
that there are racists who say and do racist things, but they are a small number
and when they discriminate or use violence, their actions are illegal. Because 
of this, one would argue, it is fair to criticize the specific racist cop or 
condemn that particular white supremacist who committed murder. But to speak of 
systematic racism would be to speak of something that, one might claim, no 
longer exists.
 
So, if there is no systematic racism, then those who criticize it are 
criticizing an illusion. Worse, the argument goes, those who speak of systematic
racism involving whites are unfairly and wrongly accusing white people of crimes
they are not committing. To illustrate, to speak of white privilege is to claim 
that white people enjoy advantages over minorities and is to accuse them of 
being engaged in systematic racism. But since there is no systematic racism on 
the part of whites, the accuser must be the real racist. After all, they are 
acting on an unfounded prejudice and attacking people based on their being 
white. Thus, those who accuse white people of being bigots and racists are 
alleged to be the real bigots and racists.
 
One weak point of this version is that holding that racism is just limited to a 
“few bad apples” is that there is abundant evidence discrimination exists and is
more than just a few bad apples. But this more plausible version can be 
incorporated into the argument. In this version, it can be accepted that racism 
against minorities does exist, but racism and against white people is on par 
with this racism. Roughly put, if it is implausible to deny the existence of 
racism against minorities, one can instead argue that whites are now equal (or 
greater) victims of racism.
 
On this revised version, a white person could accept racism exists, but insist 
they are not a racist and they are a victim of racism against whites. They would
be victims, one infers, because they have been accused of being racist because 
they are white and not because evidence, they are racists. If they wished to go 
beyond defending themselves, they could contend whites in general are not racist
and hence the critics of racism (against minorities) are bigoted against whites 
by condemning all whites because of some racist whites. But is this a good 
argument?
 
When assessing any argument, there are two general questions. The first is: “is 
the reasoning good?” The second is: “are the premises true or at least 
plausible?” One can reason well with untrue claims, reason badly with true 
claims and so on. Such, we need to assess the above reasoning both in terms of 
quality of the logic and the plausibility of the claims.
 
On the face of it, the logic of the argument mirrors good arguments about racism
and discrimination:
 
Premise 1: Person P is accused of being X by person Q.
 
Premise 2: The only evidence given by Q for P being X is that they are of race 
R.
 
Premise 3: P’s being R is irrelevant to proving P is X.
 
Conclusion: Q is being a racist.
 
As an example:
 
Premise 1: Barry is accused of being a racist by Karen.
 
Premise 2: The only evidence given by Karen for Barry being a racist is that 
Barry is white.
 
Premise 3: Barry’s being white is irrelevant to proving Barry is a racist.
 
Conclusion: Karen is being a racist.
 
But what if someone presents evidence that P is X that is not just based on 
race?
 
Premise 1: Person P is accused of being X by person Q.
 
Premise 2: The evidence given by Q for P being X is E (which is not based on P’s
race).
 
Premise 3: P denies E.
 
Conclusion: Q is being a racist.
 
This is clearly bad logic; although it also does not follow that Q is not being 
racist—it neither proves nor disproves this. To illustrate:
 
Premise 1: Barry is accused of being a racist by Karen.
 
Premise 2: The evidence given by Karen for Barry being a racist is an abundance 
of racist tweets, statements, policies, actions and so on.
 
Premise 3: Barry denies the evidence and says he is not a racist.
 
Conclusion: Karen is being a racist.
 
This is also bad logic; denying the evidence does not prove that Karen is a 
racist. She could, of course, be a racist—but this bad logic does nothing to 
prove it.
 
What some people accused of racism do, it seems, is trying to run the first 
argument. This would be smart, since the reasoning seems solid. Those critical 
of a racist would contend that the racist cannot use the first argument because 
the second premise is false. Instead, a racist can only use the second argument 
in which they deny they are a racist and claims their critics are racist.
 
The battle, as one would expect, comes down to the truth of the claims rather 
than the logic. For the “you’re the racist” defense to be a good argument (good 
logic and plausible premises), then he would need to establish key claims. The 
exact claims would depend on which specific strategy is being used. Those who 
claim that racism against minorities no longer exists would need to prove that. 
This seems unlikely given the body of existing evidence[2]. Those who claim that
it is not as bad as is claimed by expert critics (and not straw people) would 
need to prove that. Those who claim that discrimination against whites exists 
and that it is comparable to racism against minorities would need to prove that.
An alleged racist would also need to show that the evidence presented that they 
are racists does not support this claim. Finally, they would need to show that 
those accusing them of racism are acting from bigotry against whites. Just 
showing that they are not a racist would not show those accusing him are. They 
could be wrong, but it would not follow that they are racist.
 
The overwhelming evidence is that we white people are not the victims of racial 
discrimination, despite the[3] claim that we are the real victims of racism. 
White people are, however, often right to see themselves as victims—of Trump’s 
policies.[4] Most white people do face challenges: corporations have moved jobs 
overseas, wages have been stagnant, health care is expensive, an opioid epidemic
has been ravaging America, and the grotesque mismanagement of the pandemic did 
incredibly harm. But these are not the result of white people being white nor of
minorities discriminating against whites. Rather, these are the result of the 
political, economic and social system that has been crafted over the decades—one
that hurts everyone who is not rich enough to fare well in this dystopia.
 
In another way, the matter is also resolved: the lines are drawn, the hats are 
on and few are switching teams at this late date.
