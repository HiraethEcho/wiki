# Text Formatting 

You can have lists like this

- first
- second
- third

Or checklist lists to

- [ ] ==Get==
- [ ] things
- [ ] ~~done~~

Also, get highlights and strikethroughs as above (similar to Obsidian).


More formatting options for your webpage [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/formatting/#highlighting-changes). (but not compatible with Obsidian)
