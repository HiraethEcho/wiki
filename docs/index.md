# My online wiki
I'm using zotero, obsidian and mkdocs to create a wiki.
This is the mkdocs part of it, and is hosted by github pages.

<!-- - [About](/wiki/About/index): More details about this wiki. -->
- [Code](wiki/code/index.md): My notes about code, computer and sofeares.
- [Life](wiki/life/index.md): My note about daily life. Some interesting things I want to remember.
- [Math](wiki/math/index.md): My notes about math. Mostly about Algebraic Geometry.
- [Reading](wiki/reading/index.md): My Reading notes. (Sadly no notes now, hope to keep a hobit)
- [Zotero](/wiki/zotero/index): My annotation and notes exported from `zotero` by `Better Notes for Zotero` .
