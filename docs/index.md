# My online wiki
I'm using zotero, obsidian and mkdocs to create a wiki.
This is the mkdocs part of it, and is hosted by github pages.

<!-- - [About](/wiki/About/index): More details about this wiki. -->
- [Code](/wiki/Code/index): My notes about code, computer and sofeares.
- [Life](/wiki/Life/index): My note about daily life. Some interesting things I want to remember.
- [Math](/wiki/Math/index): My notes about math. Mostly about Algebraic Geometry.
- [Reading](/wiki/Reading/index): My Reading notes. (Sadly no notes now, hope to keep a hobit)
- [Zotero](/wiki/zotero/index): My annotation and notes exported from `zotero` by `Better Notes for Zotero` .
