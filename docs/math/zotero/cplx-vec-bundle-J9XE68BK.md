# cplx vec bundle

Definition. Let X be a differentiable manifold. A complex vector bundle of rank r over X is a differentiable manifold E together with a surjective map π : E → X such that (1) for every x ∈ X, the fibre E x := π −1 (x) is isomorphic to C r (2) for every x ∈ X, there exists an open neighbourhood U of x and a diffeomorphism h : π −1 (U ) → U × C r such that π| π −1 (U ) =p 1 ◦h and for all x ∈ U , p 2 ◦h:E x →C r is a C-vector space isomorphism 6 . We call (U, h) a local trivialisation of the vector bundle E.
