# My online wiki

I'm using zotero, obsidian and mkdocs to create a wiki. This is the mkdocs part of it, and host by github pages.

## Build

MkDocs template [![Built with Material for MkDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material_for_MkDocs-526CFE?style=for-the-badge&logo=MaterialForMkDocs&logoColor=white)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
use [this link](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs/generate) to generate from template.

## Configuring your website

### How do I arrange notes as sections and pages?

By default, the sections and pages will follow the folder structure within `/docs`. The folders and sub-folders will show up as sections. Try not to have white spaces in your folder and file names, as these will be converted to HTML links. The webpage heading will be the same as the first-level heading in the markdown note.

- The Materials theme provides multiple options to arrange [sections](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#navigation-sections), use [navigation tabs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#navigation-tabs), and many other helpful [navigation setups](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/)
