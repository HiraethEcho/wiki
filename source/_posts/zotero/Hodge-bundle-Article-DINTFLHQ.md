Hodge bundle

“The Hodge bundle (or automorphic bundle), denoted by L (Λ, Γ), is a fundamental fractional (orbifold) line bundle on FΛ(Γ); it is deﬁned as the quotient of OD + Λ (−1) by Γ, where OD+ Λ (−1) is the restriction to D+ Λ of the tautological line bundle on P(ΛC). We recall that L (Λ, Γ) extends to an ample fractional line bundle L ∗(Λ, Γ) on the Baily–Borel compactiﬁcation FΛ(Γ)∗, and that the sections of mL ∗(Λ, Γ) are precisely the weight-m Γ-automorphic forms. We let λ(Λ, Γ) := c1(L (Λ, Γ)); thus, λ(Λ, Γ) is a Q-Cartier divisor class.” <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9666949%2Fitems%2FKL3N454Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221663%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/KL3N454Z">Laza 和 O’Grady, 2019, p. 1663</a></span>)</span>
