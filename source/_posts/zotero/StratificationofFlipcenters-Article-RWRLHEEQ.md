More precisely, let H := π−1(supp Δ); then H is a union of hyperplane sections of D, and hence is stratiﬁed by closed subsets, where a stratum is determined by the number of independent sheets (“independent sheets” means that their deﬁning equations have linearly independent differentials) of H containing the general point of the stratum. The stratiﬁcation of H induces a stratiﬁcation of supp Δ, where the strata of supp Δ are indexed by the “number of sheets” (in D, not in F = Γ \D). Roughly speaking, Looijenga predicts that a stratum of supp Δ corresponding to k (at least) sheets meeting (in D) is ﬂipped to a dimension k − 1 locus on the GIT side.”</a></span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9666949%2Fitems%2F7XJ6STPQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/7XJ6STPQ">Laza 和 O’Grady, 2018, p. 226</a></span>)</span>
