MMPforFdlt

“Theorem A. Let (X, F, B) be a Q-factorial projective F-dlt foliated triple such that F is algebraically integrable. Let A be an ample R-divisor on X. Then: (1) The cone theorem, contraction theorem, and the existence of flips hold for (X, F, B). In particular, we can run a (KF + B)-MMP. (2) If KF + B + A is nef, then KF + B + A is semi-ample1. (3) If B ≥ A ≥ 0, then (X, F, B) has a good minimal model or a Mori fiber space. (4) If KF + B + A is Q-Cartier, then the canonical ring of KF + B + A, R(X, KF + B + A) = +∞ ⊕ m=0 H0(X, OX (⌊m(KF + B + A)⌋)), is finitely generated.” <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9666949%2Fitems%2F3JUBSMBQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22%22%2C%22prefix%22%3A%22%22%2C%22suffix%22%3A%22%22%2C%22itemData%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9666949%2Fitems%2F3JUBSMBQ%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22article%22%2C%22abstract%22%3A%22By%20systematically%20introducing%20and%20studying%20the%20structure%20of%20algebraically%20integrable%20generalized%20foliated%20quadruples%2C%20we%20establish%20the%20minimal%20model%20program%20for%20%24%5C%5Cmathbb%20Q%24-factorial%20foliated%20dlt%20algebraically%20integrable%20foliations%20and%20lc%20generalized%20pairs%20by%20proving%20their%20cone%20theorems%2C%20contraction%20theorems%2C%20and%20the%20existence%20of%20flips.%20We%20also%20provide%20numerous%20applications%20on%20their%20birational%20geometry%20and%20resolve%20a%20conjecture%20of%20Cascini%20and%20Spicer.%22%2C%22DOI%22%3A%2210.48550%2FarXiv.2309.15823%22%2C%22note%22%3A%22arXiv%3A2309.15823%20%5Bmath%5D%22%2C%22number%22%3A%22arXiv%3A2309.15823%22%2C%22publisher%22%3A%22arXiv%22%2C%22source%22%3A%22arXiv.org%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Minimal%20model%20program%20for%20algebraically%20integrable%20foliations%20and%20generalized%20pairs%22%2C%22URL%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2309.15823%22%2C%22author%22%3A%5B%7B%22family%22%3A%22Chen%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Guodu%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Han%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Jingjun%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Liu%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Jihao%22%7D%2C%7B%22family%22%3A%22Xie%22%2C%22given%22%3A%22Lingyao%22%7D%5D%2C%22accessed%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222023%22%2C11%2C3%5D%5D%7D%2C%22issued%22%3A%7B%22date-parts%22%3A%5B%5B%222023%22%2C9%2C28%5D%5D%7D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/3JUBSMBQ">Chen 等, 2023</a></span>)</span>
