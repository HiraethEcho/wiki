## First

### starter

Mori: Characterization of projective space.

Hartshorne's conjecture:

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ over algebraically closed field of and Characteristic. Then $T_X$ ample iff $X\cong \mathbb{P}^n$.

Note that a vector bundle $E$ is ample (nef) if $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(E)}(1)$ is ample (nef).

### section 1

Def:
$f: \mathbb{P}^1\to X$ a nonconstant morphism is called a rational curve on $X$.

Grothendieck's moduli: $Mor(Y,X)$

e.g. consider $Mor(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathbb{P}^n)$, a map $\mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^n$ is given by

$$ [u:v] \mapsto [F_0(u,v):\cdots:F_n(u,v)] $$
where $F_i$ are homogeneous polynomials
